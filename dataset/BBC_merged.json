        "content": "Every winter, architect Kevin Adams would perform his early morning ritual of devotion. Cloth in hand, he'd head to the stylish Crittall windows in the East London flat where he once lived - because these windows, though stylish, were also sopping wet.\n\"You'd know to expect it - you wipe it down, you open the window as soon as you can, you don't let it puddle or rot the sills,\" he says of the moisture that used to form on the single-glazing and thin steel frames of his windows when the weather was cold.\n\"I put up with it because I loved them. We do all kinds of things for love, don't we?\"\nNot everyone who has lived with vintage steel-framed windows feels so affectionate towards them, however.\nCrittall Windows became synonymous both with modernism - and condensation, which can lead to serious problems such as mould, says Mr Adams, a teaching fellow at the Edinburgh College of Art. \nWhile many consider such windows iconic and a key part of British architectural heritage, given today's high energy prices and rising awareness around the dangers of mould, efficient windows have become essential. Crittall, like all other companies in the glazing industry, has had to stay relevant to survive.While many consider such windows iconic and a key part of British architectural heritage, given today's high energy prices and rising awareness around the dangers of mould, efficient windows have become essential. Crittall, like all other companies in the glazing industry, has had to stay relevant to survive.\nThe firm, now based in Witham, Essex, has been manufacturing steel-framed windows since the 1880s. The frames Crittall developed could be mass produced, then simply cut and welded to fit an array of standard window sizes.The firm, now based in Witham, Essex, has been manufacturing steel-framed windows since the 1880s. The frames Crittall developed could be mass produced, then simply cut and welded to fit an array of standard window sizes.\nThe style was popular in both commercial and residential buildings during the 1920s and 1930s but also after World War Two, says Adams. \"Perfect for a post-war economy that was mass building without much money and with a shortage of materials,\" he explains.\nFactories and warehouses often benefitted from metal-framed windows - lightweight but strong steel meant the frames could be extra thin, allowing more room for glass, which let natural light flood through. Workers appreciated this - but so did the wealthy, who wanted light, airy homes.\nA large, art deco country house built by Walter Crittall in the 1930s was listed for sale last year at £1.65m. A large, art deco country house built by Walter Crittall in the 1930s was listed for sale last year at £1.65m. \nOn the Crittall factory floor today, there is a machine that dates to the 1920s. It is still used occasionally for gently bending steel frame sections into curved pieces, says managing director Russell Ager: \"It's an incredible piece of kit.\"\nBut the company has moved on in many other ways, he stresses, and nearby machines in the building are now state-of-the-art. \"We've done so much work to improve the thermal performance of the products,\" adds Mr Ager.\nToday you can get double and even triple-glazed Crittall windows. And crucially, the steel frames are now made with a thermal break, a glass fibre section of insulation within the frame that prevents heat escaping through its structure.\nThe lack of a thermal break is what made the older frames so prone to becoming cold when the weather outside was chilly. Cold glass and steel encourage moisture in the indoor air to condense.\nThe latest Crittall windows can achieve a U-value - a measure of their insulating performance - as low as 0.8, which is better than standard double-glazed windows.\nThey are heftier than the vintage versions but Crittall has retained the classic look of relatively skinny metal frames and rectangular or square panes of glass. TikTok and Instagram accounts focusing on home décor often feature windows such as this, though Crittall has many competitors now that make similar-looking products, admits Mr Ager.\nAccording to Mr Adams, in the post-war era, there weren't many other firms operating in the same market as Crittall in the UK. But that has changed. Many companies, including KJM Group and Velfac offer aluminium alternatives. And there are other steel window makers out there, too, such as Fabco.\n\"Most consumers… buy our product because they love the look of it,\" says Mr Ager. Business, at the moment, is good.\nDuring the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, Crittall's sales to residential customers seeking to improve their properties spiked by 30%. And while this was then followed by a decrease, currently the firm's orders in 2024 are up 20% on last year already, says Mr Ager.\nMore technology of business\nDated heritage installations reaching the end of their life present another opportunity. Crittall recently replaced 100-year-old windows that the firm had made for a building in Central London with new, energy efficient versions of the same products.Dated heritage installations reaching the end of their life present another opportunity. Crittall recently replaced 100-year-old windows that the firm had made for a building in Central London with new, energy efficient versions of the same products.\nThis kind of upgrade is not accessible to all, however, because of the relatively high cost of contemporary glazing, notes Claire Bennie, director of Municipal, a housing design and development consultancy.\n\"Every year we have a chat about it at our AGM and everyone is afraid of taking the plunge,\" she says, referring to residents' meetings at the block of 1930s flats in London where she lives. The old Crittall windows in the property give the building \"elegance\", says Ms Bennie but also makes them \"freezing\".\nHer own flat's windows are not prone to condensation - but only because they are so draughty that they stay well-ventilated, she explains. \nIt will be increasingly difficult to justify the installation of new metal-framed windows in the future because of the embodied carbon in materials such as steel, says Ms Bennie. To reduce emissions and tackle climate change, sustainable timber building products ought to become more and more prominent, she argues.\nMr Ager says Crittall windows are made with 100% recycled steel and the company is working to make its products and operations as sustainable as possible.\nOther challenges facing the company in the coming years, include the possibility that building regulations in England will change, so as to demand extremely energy efficient windows in new build properties. Stricter standards could mean a need to make the frames thicker still and even better insulated, says Mr Ager: \"The frames would almost become unrecognisable. It would be a big issue for anybody that makes a metal frame.\"Other challenges facing the company in the coming years, include the possibility that building regulations in England will change, so as to demand extremely energy efficient windows in new build properties. Stricter standards could mean a need to make the frames thicker still and even better insulated, says Mr Ager: \"The frames would almost become unrecognisable. It would be a big issue for anybody that makes a metal frame.\"\nSustainability is paramount, stresses Ms Bennie, but she does say the ergonomic design of Crittall windows is hard to beat. The windows are often easy to open into a position where you can reach outside and clean them yourself, for instance. And the classic balcony doors made by the firm fold back neatly so as not to take up precious space outside.\n\"I wish modern window manufacturers would take a lesson from Crittall,\" she says, \"In how to make windows liveable and a pleasure to use.\" ",

        "content": "After Bitcoin's price banked a new all time high in March, the sticky subject of cryptocurrencies is back in the spotlight. \nAnd while crypto market-moving events such as Bitcoin \"halving\" or the launch of \"spot ETFs\" may be familiar to crypto fans, their meaning is less obvious to many.\nBut worry not.\nIf you're hearing these for the first time, or just need a refresher, here are a few key words and what they mean.\nWhile many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies - the dollar or pound, for example - Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile - rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers.  \nThroughout February and March 2024, its price rose rapidly and it briefly reached a new record high. But its value can plummet just as quickly as it spikes - a pattern which has been repeated multiple times since the cryptocurrency was launched.Throughout February and March 2024, its price rose rapidly and it briefly reached a new record high. But its value can plummet just as quickly as it spikes - a pattern which has been repeated multiple times since the cryptocurrency was launched.\nThe blockchain, the system that underpins Bitcoin, is sustained by rewarding so-called \"miners\" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency.\nHowever, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. \nSo roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin \"halving\" (or \"halvening\") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125.\nThis ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers.\nBlockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. \nEvery cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. \nThe incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.\nA crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, from their banks into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.\nA crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. It stores the virtual assets much like a traditional wallet holds cash. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USBs that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.\nEthereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. \nIt functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.\nETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day.

        "content": "Colorado-based New Belgium Brewing can trace its roots to 1988 and a cycle trip through Belgium. \nThe experience inspired co-founders Kim Jordan and Jeff Lebesch to bring Belgian brewing techniques back to their home town.\nThree years later and the duo were selling Fat Tire, one of their first beers at a local festival, and they now have over a dozen beers in production.\nBut while they have spent 30 years creating flavours unique to the US market, they have at least one thing in common with all brewers - the use of steam.\nSteam is used to sanitise their brewing equipment, as well as being a key part of the brewing process.\nLarge cone-shaped kettles are used to boil wort - liquid extracted from the initial brewing stage of mashing barley - generating steam.\nThis boiling process helps to remove flavours the brewer does not want in the beer, before the wort is transferred to vessels to ferment with yeast, resulting in beer.\nSome of the steam generated by the kettles is captured by a heat exchanger, which allows the brewer to use this waste heat in the next batch of brewing.\nThe driving force behind the industrial revolution, steam remains crucial to production processes across multiple industries.\nAs well as its frequent use in the food and beverage industry, steam is also used for sterilisation by pharmaceutical companies, and for heating a wide range of buildings such as hospitals.\nBut steam is still primarily generated using boilers run on fossil fuels, giving it a big carbon footprint.\nFossil fuels made up 73% of industrial energy use in the US in 2018, with 40% of these fossil fuels used to heat boilers producing steam.Fossil fuels made up 73% of industrial energy use in the US in 2018, with 40% of these fossil fuels used to heat boilers producing steam.\nTo cut that, one option would be to switch to electric. Assuming the electricity is generated from sustainable sources, then the carbon footprint is slashed.\nBut using electricity does have downsides.\n\"The biggest challenge is cost, which is likely to limit the pace of customer adoption,\" says Maurizio Preziosa, from UK-based engineering firm Spirax Group.\nWhile cost might be an issue, the switch is relatively straightforward. \nMr Preziosa says that his firm's technology can usually slot into the existing system.\n\"Customers can continue to use the rest of their existing steam infrastructure,\" Mr Preziosa explains.\nThis has the additional benefit of reducing downtime, a potential obstacle to adoption for companies reliant on tightly calibrated production processes. \nUS-based AtmosZero has a different approach to creating steam. Their boiler is a heat pump, which extracts heat from the air and turns it into high temperature steam. \nIt works by circulating liquid refrigerants with low boiling points through a closed loop, capturing warmth from the air.\nThe slightly warmed refrigerant is compressed, raising it to a temperature high enough to boil water. \nA heat exchanger then transfers that heat from the refrigerant, to water to make steam. \nThe big advantage of this approach is that it cuts operating costs.\nThe company's chief executive, Addison Stark estimates that their heat pump technology could save companies hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to the options currently available.\n\"Being a heat pump-based system, we are significantly more efficient than current boilers - we create about two units of heat output for one unit of energy input, dramatically reducing the operating costs,\" Mr Stark explains.\nMore technology of business\nAtmosZero is still in the early stages, with more development work needed. The goal is to build a manufacturing plant and start delivering boiler systems in early 2026.\nMr Stark is confident the system will work at the scale needed by industry. \"We are mass-manufactured and simple to deploy.\"\nMakers of green steam equipment see demand rising in the coming years. \n\"The expectations of end consumers are shifting,\" Maurizio Preziosa from Spirax Group explains.\n\"They want to buy from companies who operate sustainably by reducing their impact on people and planet, and this, along with regulatory pressure, is driving demand from our customers who serve those consumers,\" he says.\nBack in Colorado, preparations are under way at New Belgium Brewing where AtmosZero will be swapping out one of the brewery's combustion boilers for their heat pump system.\nThis is the next step on a journey of sustainability the company has been on since those early days selling their beer at local festivals. \nAs well as installing solar panels and creating electricity from wastewater, Fat Tire, one of their first beers, became the first certified carbon neutral beer in America in August 2020.\nThis is part of a wider company ambition to become completely carbon neutral by 2030.\nChanging the way they use steam may just be the key step towards this goal.",

        "content": "Shoppers probably don't think much about what happens next when they place an online grocery order.\nBut it sets-off an intricate dance of software, artificial intelligence, robots, vans and workers.\nAt an Ocado warehouse just outside Luton, I'm in the middle of such a dance.\nAs far as I can see, hundreds of robots whizz around a grid, fetching items for online orders. They move with dizzying speed and precision.\nIn the early days of online shopping, when you placed an order, humans would dash around a warehouse or a store collecting your items.\nBut for years now, Ocado has been using robots to collect and distribute products, bringing them to staff, who pack them into boxes for delivery.\nAnd Ocado is not the only firm investing in such automation.\nIn its warehouses, Asda uses a system from Swiss automation firm Swisslog and Norway's AutoStore. In the US, Walmart has been automating parts of its supply chain using robotics from an American company called Symbotic.\nBack in Luton, Ocado has taken its automation process to a higher level.\nThe robots which zoom around the grid, now bring items to robotic arms, which reach out and grab what they need for the customer's shop.\nBags of rice, boxes of tea, packets of crumpets are all grabbed by the arms using a suction cup on the end.\nIt might seem like a trivial addition, but training a robot to recognise an item, grab it successfully and move it, is surprisingly difficult. \nAt Ocado around 100 engineers have spent years training the artificial intelligence (AI) to take on that task. \nJames Matthews, chief executive of Ocado Technology explains the AI has to interpret the information coming from its cameras. \n\"What is an object? Where are the edges of that object? How would one grasp it?\"\nIn addition the AI has to work out how to move the arm. \"How do I pick that up and accelerate in a way without flinging it across the room? How do I place it in a bag?\" he says.\nThe Luton warehouse has 44 robotic arms, which at the moment account for 15% of the products that flow through the facility, that's about 400,000 items a week. The rest are handled by staff at picking stations. \nThe staff handle items that robots are not ready for yet, like wine bottles which are heavy and have curved surfaces, making them difficult to grasp.\nBut the system is ramping up. The company is developing different attachments for the robot arms that will allow them to handle a wider variety of items.\n\"We're just playing it carefully and ramping slowly over time,\" says Mr Matthews. \"It's a deliberate constraint on our behalf, so we continue providing good service to people, and not crushed custard creams in every order, or worse, putting stuff on the track that goes under the wheels of one of the bots and creates an incident.\"\nIn two or three years Ocado expects the robots will account for 70% of the products. \nThis inevitably means fewer human staff, but the Luton warehouse still has 1,400 staff, and many of those will still be needed in the future.\n\"There will be some sort of curve that tends towards fewer people per building. But it's not as clear cut as, 'hey, look, we're on the verge of just not needing people'. We're a very long way from that,\" Mr Matthews says.\nOcado is hoping to sell its automation technology to companies outside the grocery sector. Late last year it announced a deal with Canada's McKesson, a large pharmaceuticals distributor.\n\"Think about which industries have the need to move things around efficiently inside of warehouse... it's endless,\" says Mr Matthews. \nMore technology of business\nSo where will the automation of warehouses end? Are we heading to human-free warehouses that can run 24 hours a day?\nNot so fast, says Sarah Bolton, who specialises in commercial real estate at law firm Taylor Wessing.\n\"It's almost prohibitively expensive, we're talking hundreds of millions of pounds to fully automate a warehouse,\" she points out. \n\"So you're really only talking about the big tenants in the really big warehouses looking at full automation, just because you have to have that size to make it anywhere near financially viable.\"\nShe also points that automation needs modern buildings, including floors that can stand heavy weights, large spaces without support columns, so there's less for the robots to crash into. Reliable electricity connections are also vital.\n\"You're reliant on new build, and there's a massive undersupply of new build warehouse stock in the UK at the minute,\" says Ms Bolton. \nAutoStore is tackling some of those challenges. It has a company called Pio which is developing automation for smaller businesses.\nIt uses much of the same technology that AutoStore supplies to big firms - robots buzzing around on a storage grid where goods are stacked vertically.\nHowever the upfront costs of Pio's system are lower, with the cost related to the volume of goods the system handles. The software is simpler and designed to integrate easily with common e-commerce systems like Shopify.\n\"It's a complete offering... where the upfront cost is very reduced. So it's quite affordable for these companies to get access to automation and start to get the benefits out of it. And since the technology is very flexible and scalable, you can continue to basically increase volume by adding more robots rather than more storage capacity,\" says Carlos Fernández, chief product officer at AutoStore.\nAt the moment 10 clients are running Pio's automation system with another five customers signed up.\nMr Fernández sees huge growth potential. \n\"Over the coming years, there's going to be a journey of making the technology simpler and more affordable. It won't require you to be a large corporation to run complex automation projects, and you won't need to invest big amounts of capital also to start getting the benefits.\"",

        "content": "In February US company LanzaJet, which produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol, announced that it intended to build a second, larger plant on US soil.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was a \"big influence\", says Jimmy Samartzis, its chief executive.\nThe second plant would add to its facility in Soperton, Georgia - the world's first commercial scale ethanol-to-SAF plant.\n\"We have a global landscape that we are pursuing…[but] we have doubled down on building here in the United States because of the tax credits in the IRA, and because of the overall support system that the US government has put in place.\" \nSigned into law by President Biden in August 2022, the IRA, along with the so-called Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) enacted in November 2021, are intended, amongst other things, to funnel billions of federal dollars into developing clean energy. \nThe aim is to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and incentivise private investment, to encourage the growth of green industries and jobs: a new foundation for the US economy.\nWith a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (£310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology.With a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (£310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology.\nThe tax credits are available to companies for either domestically producing clean energy, or domestically manufacturing the equipment needed for the energy transition, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries.\nConsumers can also receive tax credits, for example for buying an EV or installing a heat pump. The tax credit for SAF producers like LanzaJet is new in the IRA and, offers between $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF (though it only lasts five years).\nComplementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (£61bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law. Complementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (£61bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law. \nOne company to benefit so far is EV battery recycling company Ascend Elements.\nIt has won BIL grants totalling $480m (£380m), which it is matching a similar amount in private investment to build its second commercial facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. \n\"[The IRA and BIL] are massive investments… larger than the infrastructure related provisions in the New Deal,\" says Adie Tromer from the Brookings. \"There is a clear sense that America has become more serious about transitioning to a cleaner economy.\"\nWhile rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments.While rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments.\nAccording to recently updated CIM data, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government invested approximately $34bn (£27bn) into clean energy, the vast majority through tax credits.\nThe extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising.The extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising.\nTotal clean energy investment in the US in the 2023 calendar year including from both private and government sources reached a record $239bn (£190bn), up 38% from 2022 according to the CIM data.\nClean energy investment in the US, as a share of total private investment, rose from 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe IRA has had two main positive effects thus far, says Mr Houser. \nIt has \"supercharged\" private investment in more mature technologies which were already growing very rapidly like solar, EVs and batteries. \nIt has also, combined with the BIL, led to a \"dramatic growth\" in investment in emerging climate technologies like clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and removal and SAF. While the total magnitude of those investments are still relatively small compared to the more mature technologies, \"the IRA fundamentally changed the economics\" says Mr Houser.\nBut the IRA is failing to reach some parts of the green economy: so far it hasn't lifted investment in more mature technologies which have been falling like wind and heat pumps, though Mr Houser notes things may have fallen further without the IRA.\nOn the industry's mind is the fate of the laws, particularly the longer-to-run IRA, should there be a change of government in the US November elections. \nRepealing or amending the IRA (or BIL) would require Republican control of the Presidency, Senate and House - though wholesale repeal would likely face meaningful opposition from within. The rub is many of the projects that the IRA is incentivising are being or will be built in Republican states or counties. \nYet a Republican president alone could potentially frustrate things for example by slowing or deferring loans or grants, or amending the rules which serve the laws. \"A Trump presidency would definitely chill the atmosphere and possibly more,\" says Ashur Nissan of Kaya Partners, a climate policy advice firm.Yet a Republican president alone could potentially frustrate things for example by slowing or deferring loans or grants, or amending the rules which serve the laws. \"A Trump presidency would definitely chill the atmosphere and possibly more,\" says Ashur Nissan of Kaya Partners, a climate policy advice firm.\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank and purveyor of hard-right ideas for the next conservative President, advocates repeal for both the IRA and BIL. For the organization's Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former Trump administration official, it is fiscally irresponsible for the US, with its vast deficit and debt, to be spending like this.The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank and purveyor of hard-right ideas for the next conservative President, advocates repeal for both the IRA and BIL. For the organization's Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former Trump administration official, it is fiscally irresponsible for the US, with its vast deficit and debt, to be spending like this.\nIt is also time, she says, that renewable energy such as solar and wind, into which subsidies have been poured for years, stood on their own feet. \nYet others argue the US can't afford not to take this path. And the point of the loans program is to take risks to help unlock new solutions that scale. \"It would be failing if there weren't any so called 'failures' within it,\" says Richard Youngman, of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm.\nMore technology of business\nMeanwhile, the US's approach is putting competitive pressure on Europe to do more.\nSome European clean energy manufacturing companies are now building facilities in the US to take advantage of the tax credits that otherwise would have been built in Europe including solar panel maker Meyer Burger and electrolyser manufacturers Nel and John Cockerill. \n\"The US wasn't a market for some of these companies in the past because Europe was more active,\" says Brandon Hurlbut, of Boundary Stone Partners, a clean energy advisory firm.\nThe EU's Net Zero Industrial Act (NZIA) is expected to enter into force this year. It doesn't involve new money, but seeks to coordinate existing financing and introduces domestic favourability for the first time - putting in place a non-binding target for the bloc to locally manufacture 40% of its clean energy equipment needs by 2030.\nIn the UK, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has made clear he isn't interested, nor can the UK afford to copy the IRA's approach in some \"distortive global subsidy race\" and will stick to other ways of helping. The Labour party recently scrapped its $28bn green investment plan seen as a stab at leaning into an IRA style policy.In the UK, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has made clear he isn't interested, nor can the UK afford to copy the IRA's approach in some \"distortive global subsidy race\" and will stick to other ways of helping. The Labour party recently scrapped its $28bn green investment plan seen as a stab at leaning into an IRA style policy.\nA global audience will be watching as the US's clean energy juggernaut unfolds. And if it leads others to ask what more they can do to produce clean energy products - even if just for reasons of economic opportunity - it will be good for humanity's sake, says Mr Hurlbut.",

        "content": "I was halfway through my morning run when I heard it. The sound of the apocalypse. An air raid-style siren, slowly wailing up and down in pitch, was blaring over Belfast at 0830 GMT. I glanced at the sky.\nBut nobody else nearby seemed to be taking any notice. My wife, who had her earphones in, hadn't heard the noise at all until I pointed it out. It was the same at the supermarket on the way home. The din of the siren was audible across East Belfast, and yet, life continued as normal. \nThe bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel storage facility in Belfast Harbour. It is a fire alarm and has to be so loud partly because of the large size of the facility in question.The bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel storage facility in Belfast Harbour. It is a fire alarm and has to be so loud partly because of the large size of the facility in question.\nThis kind of siren, so strongly associated in Britain with World War Two, is actually more than a century old, and has been used for all kinds of emergencies - not just Luftwaffe bombing raids.\nOther sounds and tones are sometimes deployed for outdoor alerts, but that lazily wavering siren that is so strange and chilling is still in place at multiple sites around the country - from military bases to chemical factories. Just in case.\n\"That wail pattern does a great job,\" says Evan Kerr, VP of operations at Sentry Siren, a US firm that still makes mechanical sirens. \"You need to get people's attention.\"\nHe explains that the sound is produced by a fast rotating fan inside a flat cylindrical housing, the outer rim of which is perforated with slits. It's the forcing of air through these slits, at oscillating speeds, that creates the extremely loud wail in all directions. \nThese days, this sound can be replicated by a digital recording played through loudspeakers but Mr Kerr argues that mechanical wailing sirens, which have been manufactured since at least 1905, are proven, reliable and nearly maintenance-free. He says some sirens made by his firm, previously known as Sterling Siren Fire Alarm Company, have been in place for many decades.\nIn the UK, there are air raid-style sirens in a number of locations. Notably, at the Royal Navy base in Portsmouth. This siren, which is tested regularly, would be used to warn members of the public about an accident with the nuclear-powered submarines that are stationed there.

There are no plans to change the emergency alarm system.\"\nSome siren locations are, perhaps, less obvious. Take The State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Carstairs, Scotland.

Take Hampton Water Treatment Works in West London - even it has a siren. Industrial sites that handle significant quantities of hazardous materials are also legally required to have outdoor warning systems. Take Hampton Water Treatment Works in West London - even it has a siren. \nIn Bradford, there is a siren at a large chemical plant owned by Solenis. In information sent to locals, the company explains why an accident might be harmful. A toxic cloud could form or, for example: \"A release of a flammable vapour, with subsequent ignition, may result in an explosion with the potential for damage both within the Solenis site, and outside its boundaries.\"\nAdvice from the company explains that, if people hear the siren when it is not due to be tested, they should shelter in their homes, close all windows and curtains, block incoming draughts, switch on the radio and \"stay calm and rest\".\nMore technology of business\nIn Huddersfield, chemical company Syngenta makes insecticides and other agricultural products. It too has a siren system in place to warn people in the event of a chemical emergency .\nThese are just some examples. There are dozens of outdoor warning sirens around the UK and many, though not all, use the familiar wailing pattern of a traditional air raid-style siren. One siren aficionado has even marked the locations of these systems on an online map. These are just some examples.

One siren aficionado has even marked the locations of these systems on an online map. \nThe bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel processing facility in Belfast Harbour.\nBut online rumours had claimed the noise signalled the movement of cranes at Belfast's famous Harland & Wolff (H&W) shipyard. H&W confirms that this was not the case.\nThe incident raises the question: Would people react appropriately during a real emergency?\nPeople must be informed about what sirens in their area might be used for says Andrea Davis, president and chief executive of The Resiliency Initiative, a US firm that advises communities on emergency management. \n\"So [they] are familiar - 'Hey, I know this sound, it's not a scary sound, it's an action sound - I need to do something',\" she explains.\nFailing to activate a siren during an emergency could also be harmful. Mrs Davis criticises officials in Hawaii for not using outdoor sirens when a devastating wildfire hit Maui in August 2023.Failing to activate a siren during an emergency could also be harmful. Mrs Davis criticises officials in Hawaii for not using outdoor sirens when a devastating wildfire hit Maui in August 2023.\nErica Kuligowski, a social scientist at RMIT University in Australia, who has studied the efficacy of emergency warning systems agrees that sirens must be packaged with additional information that makes it clear what the warning is about, and what people should do in response. \n\"We need a series of pieces of information or else it's difficult to prompt people to act,\" she says.\nThe range of situations that might require a siren around the world are extremely varied. Sentry Siren, for instance, recently shipped five of its units to Iceland. They'll be used to alert people to volcanic activity, which has caused significant disruption in Iceland in recent months.The range of situations that might require a siren around the world are extremely varied. Sentry Siren, for instance, recently shipped five of its units to Iceland. They'll be used to alert people to volcanic activity, which has caused significant disruption in Iceland in recent months.\nAnd Monika Pavlik, international business manager at Telegrafia, a Slovakia-based siren manufacturer, says her firm's devices have been deployed in Ukraine where they are used as contemporary air raid warning systems. Countries neighbouring Ukraine, fearful of Russian aggression, are increasingly interested in such sirens, she adds: \"It is a constant threat.\"\nTelegrafia specialises in sirens that use digital recordings rather than mechanical components for producing noise. But this means the devices can blast verbal information across an area or turn text into explanatory spoken word announcements.\nThe company's sirens, which are installed in 93 countries around the world, can also be triggered automatically - for example by sensors detecting a flood. Or, a government could set off connected sirens across an entire country in the event of a nationwide emergency.\nThese days, sirens tend to make the news as false alarms, or when tests of siren systems are reported locally. Most of the time, thankfully, there's no emergency. There's always a risk that people will ignore these audible warnings when something really has gone wrong, however, which is why taking multiple steps to inform the public about an unfolding disaster or accident is so important, say experts.\nDespite the rise of alternative technologies such as mobile phone alerts, there is still huge demand for traditional outdoor warning sirens, says Mr Kerr of Sentry Siren: \"Why wouldn't you use all the tools available to you?\"",

        "content": "The US economy grew by less than forecast in the first three months of this year but inflation gathered pace, which could delay an interest rate cut. \nOfficial figures revealed the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1.6%, far below expectations and the growth seen in the final months of 2023.\nMeanwhile, inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has increased.\nAt the start of the year, experts had been forecasting a series of interest rate cuts in the US.\nHowever, inflation is yet to fall back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and on Thursday, figures from the US Department of Commerce showed that inflation increased by 3.4% in the first three months of 2024. This is compared to an increase of 1.8% in the final three months of 2023.\nRaising interest rates makes borrowing - for things such as loans and mortgages - more expensive and theoretically is meant to encourage people to spend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening demand.\nHowever, US inflation has not fallen back as quickly as expected.\nAt the same time, economic growth - measured as gross domestic product (GDP) - has slowed from 3.4% growth in the final three months of last year to 1.6%. Economists had been expected it to decelerate but only to 2.4%.\nOlu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch, the credit rating agency, said: \"The hot inflation print is the real story in this report.\n\"If growth continues to slowly decelerate, but inflation strongly takes off again in the wrong direction, the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut in 2024 is starting to look increasingly more out of reach.\"\nThe key US interest rate is between 5.25% to 5.5% - the highest level in more than 20 years.\nStuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London, said the US Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, was \"now finding itself caught between a rock and a hard place\".\n\"The growth numbers suggest monetary policy has worked its magic and the Fed's foot on the monetary brake can be eased somewhat,\" he said.\n\"But the inflation figures suggest otherwise, and potentially even point to the need for a further tightening.\"\nThe 1.6% growth figure is the first estimate of GDP. A second reading, \"based on more complete source data\", will be released on 30 May.\nNevertheless, the economy is a key issue as the US heads towards an election later this year.",

ByteDance insists it is not a Chinese firm, pointing to the global investment firms that own 60% of it.What to know about the US push to ban TikTokCan TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?\nExperts have told the BBC the bill is \"a big deal\" but have warned it faces multiple hurdles.It could take several years before the app is blocked as legal action, likely all the way to the Supreme Court, would delay the process.In November, a U.S. federal judge in Montana blocked an effort to ban TikTok within the state.The popularity of the app with young Americans could also be problematic.“About two in three young people in the US have a TikTok account,\" said Andrew Przybylski, professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University.“The primary challenge is going to be on freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\"The UN Charter on the Rights of the Child is quite specific: young people have a right to information and a right to play, so I think it can be challenged on those grounds.”Jennifer Huddleston from the Cato institute, in Washington, said any sale might be delayed because of the “considerable” regulatory scrutiny it would attract.\"Nine months is a rather quick timeframe for this size of a transaction - it's something that is likely to have further regulatory scrutiny even without the requirements in this proposal,\" she said.\"The question remains - what does it mean to even sell TikTok in the US, is that truly possible, and what would a buyer look like?\"Exactly who would be able to buy and operate it is also a big question - the price would likely be in the tens of billions of dollars, meaning there would be few potential buyers.\nBrooke Erin Duffy, associate professor of communication at Cornell University, said TikTok users in the US had been bracing themselves for a ban \"for quite some time\".\"The Senate decision injects a heightened level of uncertainty into the livelihoods of countless content creators, influencers, and small business owners,\" she said.If it is not sold in time, the app could be blocked in the country - the US says this is because it is concerned TikTok could be used to spy on Americans, or to spread propaganda.TikTok gathers similar kinds of data to other apps, but the US is concerned this data could fall into the hands of the Chinese government - claims the company has always contested.Elsewhere, the firm has agreed to suspend its TikTok Lite rewards programme, which pays users to spend time on the app in France and Spain.European Commissioner Thierry Breton said the feature was \"toxic and addictive\", particularly when used by children, and threatened to block it unless action was taken.The EU said its investigation into the feature would continue.",

        "content": "\"We do not intend to become the world leader,\" said Hungary's foreign minister in Beijing last October, about his country's ambitious plans for manufacturing Electric Vehicle batteries, \"because the world leader is China\". \nChina has an astonishing 79% share of the lithium-ion global battery manufacturing capacity, ahead of the US on 6%. Hungary is now third with 4% and aims soon to overtake the Americans, explained Peter Szijjarto, during his visit to China.\nWith 36 factories already built, under construction or planned, his words were no idle boast. \nViktor Orban's Fidesz government has trumpeted its \"opening to the East\".\nWhen it comes to maintaining strong economic ties with Russia, Budapest draws considerable criticism. More important in economic terms are the growing ties with China and South Korea. Electric vehicles are the cornerstone of that push, and for once Hungary is attracting the envy of fellow EU members, rather than their approbation. \nBy this summer, there will be 17 flights a week between Budapest and Chinese cities. In 2023, China became the single biggest investor in Hungary with €10.7bn.  \nLooking south from the tower of the Reformed Great Church in Debrecen, the solid grey building blocks of China's CATL factory stretch into the distance. The world's biggest battery maker has a big foothold in eastern Hungary.\nUntil last year sunflowers and oilseed rape painted the landscape green and yellow. Now the Chinese SemCorp separator foil factory and the Chinese EcoPro cathode plant have sprung up too. \nGo past the construction site of Debrecen's new, all-electric BMW factory and you will find another Chinese battery maker, Eve Energy. \nMeanwhile, bulldozers in southern Hungary are stripping the soil over a 300 hectare-site to prepare it for a Chinese \"gigafactory\" for BYD electric cars.\nSouth Korean and Japanese factories have already started manufacturing batteries or battery components here.\n\"Hungary is in the centre of Europe and in close proximity to the biggest industrial players in the automotive industry,\" says Noemi Sidlo from CATL's Hungarian division.\nIt was an obvious destination and the local and national governments were keen to help, she explained. \nMr Orban's Fidesz government has bent over backwards to attract Chinese investment, promising CATL €800m in tax incentives and infrastructural support to clinch the deal - more than 10% of the €7.3bn investment.\nAdd to that Chinese investment in a high-speed railway intended to connect Central Europe to the ports of Thessaloniki and Piraeus and Budapest's enthusiasm for Chinese investment is even clearer.\nThe feeling appears to be mutual. When Chinese President Xi Jinping comes to Europe in May, he will visit just three countries - France, Serbia, and Hungary.\nWhat could still go wrong for Viktor Orban's plans? \nRather a lot, say his critics. Environmental protests against the swathe of factories are growing, despite near-silence in the Fidesz-controlled media about potential problems.\nThe mayor of Debrecen, Laszlo Papp, has refused to talk to the BBC.\nRepeated emails to the foreign ministry and the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency have gone unanswered. \nOpponents complain that there is no way to challenge the projects locally because they have been granted \"enhanced national interest\" status.\nSouth of Debrecen lies the pretty village of Mikepercs which has become increasingly dwarfed by construction sites.\n\"None of us mothers are against green cars,\" says local campaigner Eva Kozma, \"but it is incredibly unfair they built such an enormous factory here, without asking the local people.\"\nShe points to environmental issues caused by battery factories elsewhere in Hungary: \"That's not a green future if everyone here gets cancer, just because in other towns people who are luckier than us can flit around in their nice green cars.\" \nNoemi Sidlo from CATL insists her fears are ungrounded.\nWater supply is also a major headache in Debrecen.\nSituated on the Great Hungarian plain, rainfall is in decline, underground water supplies are depleted, and government plans have so far come to little to retain more of the waters that flow through the Danube and Tisza rivers.\nHungary risks trading its status as a water superpower, to become an electromobility superpower. Maps from the 19th Century show much of the current surface of the country covered in water.\nAnother problem is labour, in a country where unemployment is below 5%. \nCATL alone will need 9,000 workers, but the Hungarian government rides to power in election after election on a slogan of \"keep migrants out\".\nThe right-wing Our Homeland Movement recently highlighted the growing number of Turkish workers in Debrecen, building the BMW plant. \nAnother concern among critics is that cheap labour, cheap land, and generous government incentives will turn Hungary into a \"servant-state\" of Chinese and South-East Asian companies. \nThe government acknowledges there is a risk that wages will be kept low and domestic research and development will be affected.\n\"We have to convince the investors, not only to bring production here, but also research,\" Balazs Orban, political director of the Prime Minister's Office told the BBC. \n\"How we merge their research with the Hungarian companies. This is the biggest challenge for the upcoming 10 years.\"",

This reflects the fact he agreed to repay a £54,500 portion of his bonus that was linked to the Post Office's participation in the official inquiry.\nIn the year 2020-21, he did not get a bonus, and was paid £415,000.\nEven without being doubled, this salary looks high compared with the annual median UK wage of £34,963, while the average takings for sub-postmasters is lower.\nHowever, the average award for FTSE 100 bosses stands at £3.81m per year.\nMs Davies said Mr Read was \"obsessed with his pay, to such an extent that it was a huge distraction from me establishing myself in my new position and performing the duties that were set out in my job description\".\nShe said he was offered a 5% pay rise but found it \"insulting\".\n\"As a result, he regarded me a failure for not getting the remuneration increase,\" she said. \"What followed was a deliberate campaign to defame and ostracise me,\" she said.\nShe added that a bullying complaint had been made about Mr Read, not Mr Staunton.\nMs Davies also accused the Post Office of \"dragging their heels\" and \"misinterpreting\" her complaint which became the basis of the misconduct investigation into Mr Read.\nShe said the Post Office had tried to present her complaint as being about other people, including Henry Staunton, when it was actually \"concerned with Nick Read, and Nick Read alone\".\n\"The fact the POL [Post Office] has ignored my attempts to set the record straight and persisted with its own distorted interpretation (and has indeed privately warned me using the word \"misrepresentation\" in this context) does not give me confidence in the integrity of this investigation\", Ms Davies said. \nShe added that \"it feels to me that POL have deliberately widened the scope of their investigation to suit another agenda\".\nMs Davies added she was not issued with the terms of reference for the investigation despite giving it her full cooperation and travelling hundreds of miles to meet with the investigator.\nA letter to the committee from Mr Staunton was also published on Tuesday in which he said the complaint by Ms Davies had been \"directed at Nick Read and Nick Read alone\", rather than Mr Staunton.\nHowever, the Post Office said a \"highly reputable\" barrister had \"produced an extensive, robust, and impartial report that fully exonerated Nick Read of all the misconduct allegations levelled against him, and in so doing discredited many of the claims raised in these letters\".\nFollowing the conclusion of her investigation last week, barrister Marianne Tutin of Devereux Chambers said she was able to approach her inquiry independently in a \"fair, thorough and proportionate\" manner. \n\"I was...not placed under any pressure as to what to investigate, or not to investigate, or what findings of fact or recommendations should, or should not, be made,\" she said.\nJane Davies has declined to comment.

She hoped the money would be used to take care of her disabled son when she died, he said. But Mr Crosthwaite said he feared she would not get the money back.It was unclear what Mr Haigh meant by \"meaningful\" support and who would actually receive any money, he added. \"We'll wait and see,\" he said.\nThe BBC understands an entity connected with PTC took over the assets of the Will Writing Company, which went into administration in 2018 and whose services had originally been referred to customers by NBS.NBS maintains it wrote to customers to make clear it had no relationship to parties connected to PTC, after PTC acquired the assets of the Will Writing Company.Some customers said they had not received the first letter and argued they received a second letter too late to act on it.\nNewcastle solicitor Claire Springle said she believed some of her clients only ended up with PTC because they had accounts with the building society.NBS referred some customers the Will Writing Company to help them write wills and plan their estates, said Mr Springle.This firm then recommended some to its sister company, Family Trust Corporation (FTC), to help them put their homes and savings into trusts.Ms Springle said many of her clients, most of whom were older, did this because they thought they could avoid future care costs.\nWhen PTC took over parts of the Will Writing Company in 2018 several FTC customers switched the ownership of their trusts to PTC, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).When PTC took over parts of the Will Writing Company in 2018 several FTC customers switched the ownership of their trusts to PTC, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).After PTC went bust in 2022, it emerged it had moved its customers’ money to higher risk investments, the FCA said.NBS maintains PTC independently contacted customers inviting them to transfer to itself some less risky regulated trusts that had been set up by FTC.“This meant that, unfortunately, a lot of its customers face potential investment losses,” the regulatory body said.PTC's administrators, Kroll, said it held approximately 2,345 trusts.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

        "content": "A former Boeing employee, who was found dead in March, accused the company of \"countless\" violations of US law in testimony given just before his death.\nJohn Barnett claimed the firm tried to \"eliminate\" quality inspections at a plant that makes 787 planes.\nThe former quality control manager had been giving a formal legal deposition against the plane manufacturer.\nThe 62-year-old's death after two days of testimony was from a \"self-inflicted gunshot wound\", officials said.\nBoeing says it was \"saddened\" by Mr Barnett's death, but said the issues he raised had been reviewed and addressed.\nThe aerospace giant's safety standards are currently under the spotlight, in part due to an incident in January when a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off.\nThe transcript of Mr Barnett's deposition has now been released by his lawyers. The lengthy document runs to more than 140 pages.\nMr Barnett had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before his retirement on health grounds in 2017. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he had suffered retaliation from managers after raising a number of serious safety concerns, a charge the company denies.\nThe bulk of Mr Barnett's deposition focuses on the period from 2010 onwards, after he had moved from Boeing's facility in Everett, Washington to what was then a brand-new factory in North Charleston.\nThe plant had been set up to help assemble the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nMr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible.Mr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible.\nIn his deposition, he provided more detail on these allegations, in support of his legal complaint that he had been \"denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn\" by senior managers, who had subjected him to a gaslighting campaign, and created a \"hostile work environment\" as a result of his actions.\nA key part of his testimony focused on the alleged falsification of records relating to problems within the production process and in particular the logging of defective or substandard parts.\nHe claimed employees had been under pressure to circumvent establish procedures, set out in Boeing's own Quality Management System, to save time. A common theme within the factory, he said, was: \"We don't have time to follow processes, we're building airplanes\".\nThis, he said, had allowed \"an awful lot\" of faulty parts onto the production line, while others had simply been lost. These included two large sections of aircraft fuselage, which \"weren't anywhere to be found\".\nIn one specific instance, he claimed a contaminated and faulty tube designed to work in an oxygen system had been removed from a scrap bin and might have been installed on an aircraft that was now in service.\nSuch parts normally had to be carefully sterilised to reduce the risk of unwanted chemical reactions. Without that, he said, there was a risk that if the system was activated, it could cause an explosion that would \"bring the whole plane down\".\nHe suggested that there had been \"countless\" occasions on which paperwork had been falsified, and agreed with his lawyer's suggestion that each violation of procedure amounted to a \"criminal offense and felony\".\nMr Barnett was also deeply critical of what he saw as a drive at the South Carolina plant to reduce quality control inspections, again to speed up the manufacturing process.\n\"So the push for probably the last 15 to 20 years at Boeing is to eliminate quality [inspections]\", he said. \"But when here in Charleston they put that push on steroids\".\nBoeing's own lawyers focused more on Mr Barnett's claims that he had been retaliated against, and appeared to question his assertion that his safety concerns had not been taken seriously at the time.\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Boeing said: \"We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing and our thoughts continue to be with his family and friends.\n\"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety\".\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\n\"To ensure the safety, quality and conformance of our products, we investigate all allegations of improper behaviour. We then work diligently to address them and make improvements.\"\nMr Barnett's lawsuit is expected to continue. It will be taken forward by his mother Vicky Stokes and his brother Rodney Barnett as representatives of his estate.\nThe case is now expected to go to trial in September.",

        "description": "I have been really busy recently, writing articles about famous people.",
        "content": "I have been really busy recently, writing articles about famous people.\nI've done interviews with the likes of Zoe Ball, Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Tarrant.\nThere has been a common theme to these stories, and it is all about how each celebrity made vast sums of money from an online investment opportunity in crypto currencies.\nAnd if this all sounds a bit unbelievable, that's because it is - I hadn't done a single one of these interviews, nor written any of the articles. And none of the famous people involved, or me, would dream of endorsing crypto investments of any kind.\nInstead, the fake stories were all AI-generated scams that appeared on Facebook news feeds in a BBC template, and with my byline.\nThe fraudsters behind them hope that people will click through to the full article, and from there be tempted to invest in a fake investment scheme being promoted on the page.\nI was curious as to how these scam posts were getting onto Facebook in the first place, so I contacted Tony Gee, a senior consultant at cybersecurity firm Penn Test Partners.\nAfter examining the URL, or web address, of one scam page he said it was most likely a paid-for Facebook advert.\nMr Gee said he could tell that because the URL had a unique value that Facebook adds to allow it to track outbound clicks.\nI put this finding to Facebook's owner Meta, who said: \"We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms, and have removed the ads brought to our attention.\"\nBut how are the scammers able to get the fake ads onto Facebook news feeds in the first place? How can they get past Facebook's automated detection systems?\nProf Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, says the criminals appear to be using tools that very quickly redirect users to another web page.\nSo when the advert is first placed with Facebook, the link goes through to a harmless page, one that doesn't try to con you out of your cash. But then once this has been approved by Facebook, the fraudsters then put on a redirect that instantly takes people somewhere else - to a web page that very much wants to maliciously dent your bank account.\n\"If you control a website then it is relatively easy to include a redirect command, such that before someone's browser has had a chance to show them the original webpage, their browser is sent to an alternative one,\" says Prof Woodward.\nHe adds that the fraudsters can quickly and easily keep changing the destination of the redirect. \"As soon as you are able to obfuscate the true nature of a URL, that is manna for scammers,\" he says.\nThis is a type of online fraud called \"cloaking\", whereby malicious adverts are able to get past a social media firm's review stage because the fraudsters have hidden their intentions.\nMeta says it is using what it has learnt about this technique to improve its automated detection systems.\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nMargaret (not her real name) is a retiree who lives in Buckinghamshire. She was recently conned out of £250 when she fell victim to fake advert on Instagram, which is also owned by Meta.\nShe had been tempted to click on a link to a fictitious ITV article in which presenter Robert Peston (or rather, a scammer pretending it was him), chats about an investment opportunity he had come across. Margaret who trusts Mr Peston and the ITV brand decided to invest.\nIn addition to paying the £250, Margaret sent off pictures of her passport, and both sides of her credit card. She immediately started getting phone calls.\n\"It was someone with an American accent welcoming me and saying my money was already making money,\" she tells me.\nThe phone calls kept coming, as did a torrent of emails. Margaret became suspicious, particularly when they started asking her about her income and savings, and when she intended to invest more money.\n\"I contacted my bank and was refunded but it didn't stop the scammers.\"\nMargaret still receives daily calls, and even started getting them from someone purporting to be from the US National Security Agency promising to help her investigate the scam.\n\"My own mental health is being impacted and I believe I am at risk, in particular identity theft and indeed potential monetary theft,\" she says. \"They are so mega persistent, and are dangerous pests.\"\nIt is an issue that UK consumer watchdog Which? has been looking into.\n\"Malicious advertisers may mask web links or impersonate trusted brands such as the BBC to evade online platforms' reporting systems, and people often don't know they're looking at a scam or a deepfake until it's too late,\" says Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy.\n\"It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent content online. Ofcom must use its powers under the Online Safety Act  [which was passed late last year] to ensure that online platforms are verifying the legitimacy of their advertisers to prevent scammers reaching consumers.\"\"It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent content online. Ofcom must use its powers under the Online Safety Act  [which was passed late last year] to ensure that online platforms are verifying the legitimacy of their advertisers to prevent scammers reaching consumers.\"\nOfcom said in a statement that tackling fraud \"is a priority\" for the regulator.\n\"The UK's new online safety laws will be an important part of making it harder for fraudsters to operate,\" it added. \"Under the new laws, online services will be required to assess the risk of their users being harmed by illegal content on their platforms - including fraud, take appropriate steps to protect their users, and remove illegal content when they identify it or are told about it.\"\nNicolas Corry is managing director at financial investigation firm Skadi. He says he was \"troubled\" by the amount of causal fraud occurring on Facebook and other social media sites.\n\"These companies are making vast amounts of profits, and exposing people to fraud,\" he adds. \"And then it's the finance companies that pay for this, or the victims themselves.\"\nMr Corry says social media firms should be more rigorously checking each advert, and its links, before they allow them to go up.

        "authors": "India correspondent",
        "description": "For decades, India has been a nation of savers. They stash away a significant portion of their earnings for future security, often at the expense of current consumption. ",
        "content": "For decades, India has been a nation of savers. They stash away a significant portion of their earnings for future security, often at the expense of current consumption. \nBut something seems to be amiss now. Recent data from the Reserve Bank of India says India's net household savings stood at a 47-year-old low. Household net savings are the total money and investments families have, like deposits, stocks and bonus, minus any money they owe, like loans and debt.  \nSavings shrank to 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year 2023, down from 7.3% in 2022. One economist called this fall \"dramatic\".\nThere has also been a sharp jump in household debt in the same period. Annual borrowings stood at 5.8% of GDP - the second-highest level after the 1970s. \nAs households increasingly rely on debt to fuel consumption, their savings inevitably erode. The more they borrow, they dedicate more of their income to repaying debt, leaving less for savings. \nNikhil Gupta, economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, says a significant portion of India's increasing household debt is made up of non-mortgage loans. Farm and business loans comprise over half of these loans. (An interesting aside: In 2022, non-mortgage debt in India matched Australia and Japan, and surpassed many other major nations, including the US and China.)\nMr Gupta also found that while borrowing for consumption - credit cards, consumer durables, weddings, health emergencies, for example - makes up less than 20% of total household debt, it was the fastest-growing segment. \nSo what does this trend of low savings and high debt tell us about India's economy, the fifth largest in the world? Do increased borrowing and spending point to optimism for the future, or do they warn of challenges such as declining incomes, inflation and economic stress?  \n\"There is some amount of consumer confidence. There are many Indians who hope income growth will be strong enough in future. Or they just want to have a good life right now rather than think about what will happen to the future,\" Mr Gupta says.\n\"Is there a change in [the Indian] mindset about spending [more]? Maybe,\" he says, adding that it's not clear yet what is driving this.\nWhat about borrowing money out of necessity or desperation, typically during times of financial hardship or crisis? Extended distress borrowing could easily lead to loan defaults. On the other hand, if the lenders are doing their homework, why would they continue to lend to non-creditworthy borrowers in the throes of a financial crisis?\nA key problem, according to Mr Gupta, is the lack of granular detail in the official data on the borrowers. What kind of jobs they do? How many people have taken how many loans? (One borrower can take multiple loans.) What are they using the loans for? What is their repayment history? \nSome clues are available. Mr Gupta and fellow economist Tanisha Ladha at Motilal Oswal have found that the bulk of household debt growth in the past decade was driven by 'credit widening' - an increase in the number of borrowers - rather than 'credit deepening' or higher loans per borrower. Having more people borrowing is preferable to having each borrower take out larger loans.\nThey also found that Indian households have a debt service ratio (DSR) - the share of income used to service loans - of approximately 12%, similar to Nordic countries. This ratio is higher than that of China, France, the UK, and the US, all of which have higher household debt levels. The difference is due to higher interest rates and shorter loan tenures in India, resulting in a relatively higher DSR despite lower debt-to-income ratios.\nIn September, India's finance ministry dismissed fears about reducing savings and increasing borrowings, saying people were taking advantage of low interest rates after the pandemic to buy cars, education loans and homes. In September, India's finance ministry dismissed fears about reducing savings and increasing borrowings, saying people were taking advantage of low interest rates after the pandemic to buy cars, education loans and homes. \nAlso, it said, more people were borrowing to buy assets like home and vehicles which is \"not a sign of distress but of confidence in the future employment and income prospects\". \nZico Dasgupta and Srinivas Raghavendra of Azim Premji University, however, sound a note of caution. The decline in savings coupled with the increase in debt prompted concerns regarding \"debt repayment and financial fragility\", the two economists wrote in The Hindu.

The decline in savings coupled with the increase in debt prompted concerns regarding \"debt repayment and financial fragility\", the two economists wrote in The Hindu. \nOthers like economist Rathin Roy worry about a growing reliance on borrowing in a nation with the lowest per capita income among G20 countries. The government borrows to fund basic services and subsidies, while households borrow to consume, he noted in Business Standard. This reduces the already \"declining flow of financial savings\" and increases the cost of borrowing.Others like economist Rathin Roy worry about a growing reliance on borrowing in a nation with the lowest per capita income among G20 countries.

This reduces the already \"declining flow of financial savings\" and increases the cost of borrowing.\nMr Gupta and Ms Ladha believe that the current high level of borrowing in a year does not endanger India's financial or macroeconomic stability. But there are concerns about its sustainability if this trend persists. \n\"Consumer India's consumption is located at the crossroads of high aspiration for a better life, woefully inadequate quality and quantity of public goods and amenities and modest incomes which are also unstable,\" writes Rama Bijapurkar, a business consultant, in her new book Lilliput Land. \nIn other words, the Indian consumer is engaged in a deft balancing act.

Ms Tottori is a graduate of a far less prestigious women-only junior college.\nWith Ms Tottori's appointment, JAL has joined the less than 1% of Japan's top companies led by women.\n\"I don't think of myself as the first woman or the first former flight attendant. I want to act as an individual so I didn't expect to get this much attention.\"\n\"But I realise the public or our employees don't necessarily see me like that,\" she adds.\nHer appointment also came just two weeks after JAL's flight attendants were lauded for the successful evacuation of passengers from a plane that collided with a coast guard aircraft during landing.\nJapan Airlines Flight 516 burst into flames after the collision on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport.\nFive of the six crew on the coastguard plane died and captain was injured. However, within minutes of the collision, all 379 people on board the Airbus A350-900 had safely escaped.\nThe rigorous training of the carrier's flight attendants was suddenly in the spotlight.\nAs a former flight attendant herself, Ms Tottori learned the importance of aviation safety first hand.\nFour months after she became a flight attendant in 1985, Japan Airlines was involved in the deadliest single aircraft accident in aviation history, which killed 520 people on Mount Osutaka.\n\"Every member of staff at JAL is given an opportunity to climb Mount Osutaka and speak to those who remember the accident,\" Ms Tottori says. \n\"We also exhibit aircraft debris at our safety promotion centre so instead of just reading about it in a book, we look with our own eyes and feel with our own skin to learn about the accident.\"\nWhile her appointment in the top job came as a surprise, JAL has changed rapidly since it went bankrupt in 2010, in what was the country's biggest ever corporate failure outside the financial sector.\nThe airline managed to continue flying thanks to major state-backed financial support and the business underwent a sweeping restructuring with a new board and management.\nIts saviour was then-77-year-old retiree and ordained Buddhist monk, Kazuo Inamori. Without his transformational influence it is unlikely that someone like Ms Tottori could have become JAL's leader.\nI spoke to him in an interview in 2012.

The company also owns the Habitat brand.\nThe retailer said trading at Argos had been hit by last summer's wet weather, which affected sales of seasonal goods such as barbecues and paddling pools. \nThe weather also impacted clothes sales, as competitors launched sales to clear stock, and Sainsbury's said there had been some disruption to clothing supplies in recent months because of Houthi rebels attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\nAs Sainsbury's announced its results, a \"technical issue\" hit some of its online deliveries on Thursday.\nHowever, the retailer said the problem had been fixed, and had only affected a \"small number\" of customers.\nRead more tips hereRead more tips here",

        "content": "Women-only business networking and co-working clubs like Chief in London and The Co-Working Space in Nottingham have recently closed their doors. The concept gained a lot of traction around the height of the MeToo movement. Some women find the idea a step backwards, but for others these clubs are a way to level the playing field.\nThe idea of men-only \"gentlemen's clubs\" is well established, with centuries-old places like White's and The Garrick Club in London.\nBut women-only ones have been on the rise too over the past decade, often with a twist - they focus on the idea of co-working.\nCo-working spaces are big, open-plan offices with hot desks and nice amenities where people can come and work on a membership basis. They have grown in popularity as remote working has become easier. \nWomen-only co-working spaces hit the headlines about eight years ago thanks to The Wing in the US. It was founded in New York by Audrey Gelman, former press secretary to Hillary Clinton, against the backdrop of the MeToo movement and Donald Trump's rise to power. It raised millions in funding, with a promise of female empowerment. \nBut then it suffered a spectacular fall during the pandemic. There was a staff revolt, with allegations of mistreatment and racism. Its pricing model led to accusations of social exclusivity. It was also hit by legal challenges for sexual discrimination over its core women-only membership policy.\nThe self-proclaimed \"female utopia\" abruptly closed all of its spaces in the summer of 2022, including a branch in London.\nDespite the demise of The Wing, other women-only co-working spaces are still operating. There are about 50 in Europe, including several in the UK. One such place is The Hearth, in north London.\nBonnie Lister Parsons, founder of SOS Dance Global, a digital platform that teaches women how to dance, is a regular. So why is she a member? It's been challenging growing her business as a woman, she explains, as only about 2% of venture capital funding goes to female-led companies. \"When you are operating in a world with a lot of headwinds, being in an all-female space is refreshing - and joyful,\" she says.\nShe also says she wasn't impressed by her tour of the co-working space WeWork, where they were keen to boast about the free beer on tap: \"For the guy showing me round it was a massive selling point. I know not all women dislike beer, but personally, I couldn't care less.\" \nAudrey Gelman, founder of The Wing, used to argue that rival co-working spaces had \"pumps for beer, but not for breast milk\". Audrey Gelman, founder of The Wing, used to argue that rival co-working spaces had \"pumps for beer, but not for breast milk\". \nThe Hearth is designed to feel like \"your dream home\", according to its founder Oi Leng Lui. The walls and furnishings are relaxing, pastel colours and an aromatic smell is pumped into the space where women hot desk. There is even a wellness room.\nSusie Campbell, a business adviser and coach, is another regular.\n\"I used to work in the City for many years - a very male-dominated environment,\" she explains. \"The air conditioning was always down too low... there's something just really safe here and a sense of community.\"\nThere are a handful of other women-only co-working spaces in the UK, including Egg in Edinburgh and Maven in Winchester, a former bridal shop which the owner decided to convert. \nZoe Ellis-Moore is the founder of Spaces to Places, which advises companies on how to find the best flexible office space.\nWomen-only co-working spaces should be seen as part of a wider trend of people wanting to work flexibly in \"tribes\", she says.\n\"We've seen a huge growth in these niche areas,\" she says, \"like spaces for tech start-ups or flexible catering spaces for hospitality companies.\"\nStart-ups and freelancers want to work flexibly, but with a community of like-minded people, she points out, and women-only spaces represent a tribe, just like these.\nIn 2017, the New York City Commission on Human Rights launched an investigation into The Wing over the issue of gender discrimination and the following year, a man filed a lawsuit against The Wing in Washington DC after he was refused admission.  \nThe Wing adapted its membership rules to say that anyone could join, as long as they were committed to its mission of supporting women. \nOther women-only spaces in the US followed suit. \nThe Coven in Minnesota started in 2018 as a women-only space after a successful crowdfunding campaign and now has four spaces. It has 1,000 members but men now make up about 20% of that figure.\n\"We were hearing from members that they wanted to invite more of their male friends into the space,\" says Erin Farrell, co-founder of The Coven, \"which led us to think, when we talk about physical and psychological safety, how tied to gender is that?\" \nMs Farrell says they were aware of the legal challenges that The Wing was facing, but their own language never excluded men, it was always just women-focused, so accepting men was not a significant issue. \nThose that choose to join tend to be \"allies and accomplices\", she adds, and the clubs' amenities and programme of events remain women-focused.\nSo where does this leave women-only spaces in the UK?\n\"Equality legislation in the UK [enshrined in the Equality Act] generally protects against discrimination based on gender in the supply of services,\" according to Sarah Evans, partner at Constantine Law, which specialises in employment and discrimination law, \"but there are exceptions, including for associations, groups and private clubs.\" \n\"Criteria apply, but women-only co-working groups, with the aim of supporting and facilitating women doing business together, are highly unlikely to fall foul of anti-discrimination laws,\" she says.\nThe other pressing question is, are these spaces empowering women in the long term? Some workplace experts are not convinced.\n\"While women-only spaces can provide temporary relief from conflict, judgement, assumptions, and distractions,\" says Blaire Palmer, leadership consultant and author of Punks in Suits, \"it is vital that we all learn how to challenge each other and develop the skills to bring our unique perspective to our work. \n\"Women-only spaces are useful for exploring, in a safer environment, the challenges of being a woman in what is still not a level playing field, but they should never become a place to hide permanently.\"\nHowever, others think that women-only work clubs are counterproductive.\n\"Women-only co-working spaces are a step backwards,\" according to Anne Kirby, who set up The Candy Factory co-working space in Pennsylvania.\n\"Yes, women have unique challenges and are at a disadvantage in the business world, but how does removing yourself from real life get you anywhere? How can we expect men to understand the need for respect and equality if we subtract them from our daily work lives?\n\"We're working to disrupt the 'good ol' boys club' mentality; why create the same thing for women?\" \nBack downstairs at The Hearth, a lunch-and-learn workshop is taking place. The women who were working away on their laptops are now sitting in a square listening to a talk by Elena Megan, a self-discovery and mindset coach. \nAn audience member shares a story that perhaps explains the attraction of a women-only co-working space like this for some. She says she has always struggled to network with men because she feels they do not treat her like an equal professional. \nThe other members nod and murmur in agreement.",

        "description": "More than six months into the devastating Gaza war, its impact on the Israeli and Palestinian economies has been huge. ",
        "content": "More than six months into the devastating Gaza war, its impact on the Israeli and Palestinian economies has been huge. \nNearly all economic activity in Gaza has been wiped out and the World Bank says the war has also hit Palestinian businesses in the occupied West Bank hard. \nAs Israelis mark the Jewish festival of Passover, the much-vaunted \"start-up nation\" is also trying to remain an attractive proposition for investors.\nThe cobbled streets of Jerusalem's Old City are eerily quiet. There are none of the long queues to visit the holy sites - at least those that remain open. \nJust after Easter and Ramadan and right in the middle of Passover, all four quarters of the Old City should be teeming with visitors.\nJust 68,000 tourists arrived in Israel in February, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics. That's down massively from 319,100 visitors in the same month last year. \nWhile it may be surprising that any visitors pass through Jerusalem at a time of such tension, many of those who do are religious pilgrims from across the globe who will have paid for their journeys well in advance.\nZak's Jerusalem Gifts was one of only a handful of stores on Christian Quarter Street in the Old City, which is situated in occupied East Jerusalem, to have bothered opening up on the day I passed by.\n\"We're only really doing online sales,\" says Zak, whose business specialises in antiques and biblical coins. \n\"There are no actual people. The last week, after the Iran-Israel escalation, business dropped down again. So we are just hoping that after the holidays some big major miracle will happen.\"\nIt's not just in Jerusalem's Old City that they need a miracle.\nSome 250km (150 miles) further north, on Israel's volatile border with Lebanon, almost daily exchanges of fire with Hezbollah since the war in Gaza began have forced the Israeli army to close much of the area and 80,000 residents have been evacuated further south. A similar number of Lebanese have been forced to leave their homes on the other side of the border.\nAgriculture in this part of Israel is another economic sector that has been hit hard.\nOfer \"Poshko\" Moskovitz isn't really permitted to enter his avocado orchard in the kibbutz of Misgav Am because of its proximity to the border. But he occasionally ventures in anyway, walking wistfully among the trees, to gaze at all of his \"money falling on the ground\". \n\"I must go to pick in the orchard because it's very important for the next season,\" Poshko says. \"If I don't pick this fruit, the next season will be a very poor one.\"\nHe says he is losing a lot of money because he can't pick the avocados - around 2m shekels ($530,000; £430,000) this season, he says.\nAlthough they provide a living for thousands of people, agriculture and tourism account for relatively small parts of both the Israeli or Palestinian economies.\nSo what does the wider picture show?\nLast week ratings agency S&P Global cut Israel's long-term ratings (to A-plus from AA-minus) reflecting a loss of market confidence after increased tensions between Israel and Iran and concerns the war in Gaza could spread across the wider Middle East.\nThat loss of confidence was also reflected in falling Israeli GDP - the total value of goods and services produced in the economy - which decreased by 5.7% in the last quarter of 2023. Many Israelis though say the country's renowned high-tech and start-up sector is proving to be more \"war-proof\" than expected.\nThe coastal city of Tel Aviv is only 54km from Jerusalem. More pertinently, perhaps, it's less than 70km from Gaza. \nAt times, you'd be forgiven for forgetting - however momentarily - that Israel is embroiled in its longest war since independence in 1948.\nFamilies make the most of the early summer sun to play in the surf, couples eat lunch in the many open-air beach restaurants and young people strum away on guitars on the green spaces between the coastal road and the Mediterranean.\nThe backdrop is a city that is economically active and physically growing fast.\n\"They joke that Israel's national bird should be the crane - the mechanical kind!\" says Jon Medved, founder and CEO of the online global venture investment platform Our Crowd.\nAn engaging character with an overwhelmingly upbeat view of his world, Medved tells me that, \"in the first quarter of this year, almost $2bn was invested in Israeli start-ups…  We're having one of the best years we've ever had. People who are engaged with Israel are not disengaging.\"\nMedved insists that, despite everything, Israel is still the \"start-up nation\" and a good option for would-be investors.\n\"There are 400 multinational corporations that have operations here. Not a single multinational, has closed its operation in Israel since the war.\"\nTo an extent, Elise Brezis agrees with Mr Medved's assessment.\nThe economics professor at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv acknowledges that despite the last quarter's GDP figures, Israel's economy remains \"remarkably resilient\".\n\"When it comes to tourism, yes, we have a reduction in exports. But we had also reduction in imports,\" says Brezis. \"So in fact, the balance of payments is still okay. That's what is so problematic is that from the data, you don't really feel that there is such a terrible situation in Israel.\"\nBut Prof Brezis detects a wider malaise in Israeli society that isn't reflected in economic data.\n\"Israel's economy might be robust, but Israeli society is not robust right now. It's like looking at a person and saying, 'Wow, his salary is high,' [...] but in fact he's depressed. And he's thinking, 'What will I do with my life?' - That's exactly Israel today.\"\nIf the outlook in Israel is mixed, then across the separation barrier that divides Jerusalem and Bethlehem the view from the Palestinian side is overwhelmingly bleak.\nTourism is especially important to the economies of towns like Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. \nWhile some people are still heading to Jerusalem's sites, in the place where Christians believe Jesus was born tourism \"stopped immediately\" after 7 October last year, says Dr Samir Hazboun, chairman of Bethlehem's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nThat's when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, taking about 250 hostages and sparking the current war.\nThere's huge dependence and reliance on Israel's economy here - but Israel virtually closed off the landlocked West Bank after 7 October and this has had a disastrous impact on the life and work of many Palestinians, Dr Hazboun says.\n\"The Bethlehem governorate right now is closed,\" he says. \"There are around 43 gates [in the Israeli security barrier] but only three are open. So with between 16,000 and 20,000 Palestinian workers from our area working in Israel, immediately, they lost their income.\"\nThe chamber of commerce says that the revenues from local Palestinians working in Israel amounted to 22bn shekels ($5.8bn) annually.\n\"You can imagine the impact on the economy,\" says Dr Hazboun, who is particularly concerned for the prospects for younger Palestinians the longer the war continues and more the Israeli and West Bank economies decouple.\n\"The younger generation now are jobless, they are not working. Many of them are talented people,\" he laments.\n\"In June I'm expecting around 30,000 new graduates from the Palestinian universities. What they will do? \nIn Gaza itself the economy has been completely destroyed by six months of war. Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have killed 34,183 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nUnlike in some parts of Israel, where there is optimism around being able to ride out the storm and continue attracting investors, in the West Bank and Gaza there is little hope things will return to any kind of normal.",

        "content": "When Sammy left her village in Sichuan province to attend university in northern China more than a decade ago, she was following a well-trodden rite of passage. \nThe English language graduate was the first person in her family to go to university. She had a passion for foreign languages and dreamed of becoming a teacher. She had never heard of synthetic opioids before. \nAfter graduating, Sammy found work at a chemicals company in the Chinese city of Shijiazhuang, selling what she thought were chemicals to clients around the world. She would practice English every day speaking to her customers online, and earn a commission for each sale she made. Her dreams of becoming a teacher quickly faded.\n\"Maybe others are just like me… At the start we don't know what we are selling, but when we find out we have fallen in love with the work,\" she said. \"This work can make money,\" she adds.\nSammy [not her real name] is an unlikely drug trafficker. She is one of what international law enforcement agencies estimate could be thousands of online sales representatives, working for illicit Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical companies producing and smuggling illegal laboratory made drugs. \nThe US government has long accused China of flooding the country with deadly drugs like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin, claims the Chinese government denies. The US says Chinese-made opioids are fuelling the worst drug crisis in the country's history. In 2022 more than 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses.The US government has long accused China of flooding the country with deadly drugs like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin, claims the Chinese government denies.

In 2022 more than 70,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses.\nAccording to a report published by the US select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government provides subsidies to companies openly trafficking illicit synthetic drugs.

The report found tens of thousands of posts online advertising illegal drugs and pre-cursors.\nThe study claims that \"wholly state owned\" companies are involved in the trafficking of drugs. The Chinese government has consistently denied knowledge of the illegal drug trade.\nMany like Sammy fall into the drug trade seemingly by accident, initially unaware of the products they are peddling online and their deadly consequences. But others are more aware of what they are selling. \nEach morning Sara [not her real name] posts photos and videos across her social media platforms advertising drugs; synthetic cannabinoids, precursors for MDMA, and nitazenes, a synthetic opioid considered up to 50 times more potent than even fentanyl.\n\"We have many customers in Britain and have cooperated with them many times,\" boasts Sara, an international trade graduate, now working for an online platform. \nWhen challenged, she is not drawn into a moral discussion about selling drugs. She claims she never asks customers how they use what she sells.  \nThe UK National Crime and Agency (NCA) believes drug dealers are mixing the synthetic opioid with street drugs such as heroin.\nAccording to the NCA, there have been more than 100 deaths linked to nitazenes over the past nine months, leading health professionals to warn the UK may be facing a drug-related crisis. According to the NCA, there have been more than 100 deaths linked to nitazenes over the past nine months, leading health professionals to warn the UK may be facing a drug-related crisis. \nThe BBC has found hundreds of adverts for nitazenes online. Suppliers contacted claim to send shipments through courier services, mislabelling deliveries and hiding drugs in fake packaging. The BBC has also seen courier tracking numbers provided by online sales representative in China claiming to have made successful deliveries across the UK.\nSara entered the business after university. She thought she was selling chemicals.  She has worked in the industry for two and a half years. \"I know most of the products,\" she says.\n\"My boss has been running this company for more than seven years, and he knows lots of customers and freight forwarders. If the product is detained, he will lose the most. So he will try his best to make the product reach you smoothly,\" she adds.\nIn March, the UK government classified 15 synthetic opioids as Class A drugs. Under the Misuse of Drugs act anyone caught supplying or producing the drugs could face up to life in prison. Those caught in possession face seven years.  In March, the UK government classified 15 synthetic opioids as Class A drugs. Under the Misuse of Drugs act anyone caught supplying or producing the drugs could face up to life in prison. Those caught in possession face seven years.  \nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), China has between 40,000 and 100,000 pharmaceutical companies.\n\"China has long had one of the most significant pharmaceutical industries in Asia, as well as one of the largest chemical industries. And we've seen industry growth in other countries of the region,\" said Jeremy Douglas in late 2023, the then regional representative of the UNODC .\n\"While both industries are regulated, the challenge is significant given the sheer scale, and at the same time there are a number of ways to move products. Parcel post, air freight and shipping containers are all moving globally in high volumes,\" he said.\nMr Douglas says that synthetic drugs are disrupting the traditional drug trade. Outside of China, synthetic drugs offer opportunities for both traditional crime organisations and upstarts able to buy directly from producers half a world away. \n\"Synthetics like fentanyl have several advantages over traditional drugs - compact, easily shippable, pre-existing demand, replaceable. They're attractive to traffickers.\"\nThat was confirmed in my conversations with sales people working for Chinese pharmaceutical firms.\n\"First of all, our packaging is completely secret, no one knows what it is until you open it, and second, we will change the name of the package and will not reveal any name about the product,\" says Sara.\n\"We will get the logistics order number when we send the package, we will track the situation of the package at any time, and any anomalies can be known and solved in time,\" she adds.\nAccording to Europol, the European police agency, China is the world's biggest manufacturer and distributor of synthetic, lab-made drugs. Some mimic the effects of traditional drugs like cannabis or cocaine. Chemists synthesise new drugs in order to stay one step ahead of the law.According to Europol, the European police agency, China is the world's biggest manufacturer and distributor of synthetic, lab-made drugs.

Criminal activity was a type of social mobility.\"\nIn 2020, researchers from TraCCC studied over 350 English language websites advertising the synthetic opioid fentanyl. \"From all the adverts that we found, nearly 40% of them were from corporate registries, and the largest hub of that was in Wuhan,\" says Dr Shelly.In 2020, researchers from TraCCC studied over 350 English language websites advertising the synthetic opioid fentanyl. \"From all the adverts that we found, nearly 40% of them were from corporate registries, and the largest hub of that was in Wuhan,\" says Dr Shelly.\nThe sales people contacted by the BBC see the drug trade as simply another aspect of e-commerce. When challenged over selling drugs that damage lives, one described herself as a \"middleman.\"\n\"Somebody needs it, somebody makes it, and I am just a middleman who lets customers know that I have it and what they do with it, I don't care,\" she says. \"Then I figured out I just need to make money. I don't know and don't care. Everyone has their own needs.\"\nThe woman boasts of clients from Canada to Croatia. She provided photos of recent drugs shipments complete with labels showing a UK address.\n\"I didn't know at first until I went online and translated the product into Chinese,\" she says via a message punctuated with a teary emoji. \nAnother seller says: \"This industry is easy, and you can get higher wages, which attracts a large number of young people\". Natalie [not her real name], focuses on fentanyl.\n\"We buy from over 10 different labs and have a large selection. I have a professional shipping agent who packaged goods so has a very high delivery success rate to the UK.\"\nMeanwhile, another supplier claimed to be able to smuggle drugs into the UK hidden in dog food packaging.  \"You don't need to worry about the packaging. We guarantee you safe delivery.\" \n\"We ship in large quantities all over the world every day. Please trust our professional team. We guarantee 100% safe transportation.\" \nIn 2019, the Chinese government banned all forms of fentanyl and its analogues. In January 2024, China and the US launched a joint operation to curb the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\"As long as market demand remains high in some parts of the world then that demand will be met in one way or another,\" said Mr Douglas from the UNODC.

        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group's profits plunged by 28% in early 2024 as competition grew for mortgages and deposits.\nThe bank posted pre-tax profits of £1.6bn between January and March, down from £2.3bn last year.\nLloyds said its margins had been hit \"mainly within UK mortgages\" amid heightened competition between lenders to offer squeezed buyers better deals.\nThe UK's biggest lender also made less from loans to businesses, but more from credit cards and car finance.\nThe group, which owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, said in the three months to the end of March that its net interest income, which is the difference between the money it generates from loans and pays out for deposits, fell 10% to £3.2bn ($4bn). \nThe fall was expected as more people moved their cash into savings accounts with higher returns and mortgage rates eased because of the competition stepping up among lenders.\n\"The company has seen competition in the mortgage market bring down its returns and savers move deposits into higher interest accounts - meaning it is paying out more to customers, \" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\nLike other UK banks, Lloyds' profits were boosted by the increase in interest rates over the past couple of years, which have allowed lenders to charge more on loans. \nFor the whole of 2023, Lloyds' pre-tax profits jumped to £7.5bn, which was higher than expected and up 57% on 2022.\nBorrowing costs have risen as the Bank of England has increased its base interest rate in a bid to bring down inflation - which measures price rises over time.\nBut Mr Mould suggested that \"Lloyds' brief moment in the sun, when rates moved sharply higher and it was able to generate higher margins, seems to have come to an end\".\nIn January, competition for customers saw lenders cut rates sharply although borrowing to a buy a property has remained more expensive than many people have been used to in the past decade.\nThe Bank of England is expected to cut rates this year, but predictions of when such a move might take place has seen some lenders start raising mortgage rates in recent days.\nLloyds' rivals HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all raised rates on fixed-term loans, though not on all products, due to financial markets predicting an interest rate cut might not be as soon as previously expected.Lloyds' rivals HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all raised rates on fixed-term loans, though not on all products, due to financial markets predicting an interest rate cut might not be as soon as previously expected.\nLloyds said it still believed the Bank would cut rates by 0.25 percentage points three times before the end of 2024, which if happens, would see rates fall from 5.25% to 4.5%.\nOn Wednesday, the average two-year fixed mortgage stood at 5.83%, while the average five-year deal was 5.41%.  \nLloyds' latest results also showed the shift in more customers moving cash out of current accounts and into savings accounts had continued.\nThe group also said it had faced higher running costs in early 2024, including a new sector-wide Bank of England levy on lenders and a £100m additional charge to cover employee severance after a recent round of redundancies.\nIt confirmed it had not set aside any further cash to the £450m it has already allocated to cover the potential cost of an investigation into car finance deals by the UK's financial regulator.\nA probe into whether people had beenpaying too much for cars was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in January.A probe into whether people had beenpaying too much for cars was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in January.\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said while Lloyds' profit fall looked \"substantial from this time last year\", it had been expected.\nCharlie Nunn, Lloyds' chief executive, said the quarterly results provided the group with \"further confidence\" around its strategic ambitions and showed the bank was \"continuing to support customers\".\nAs well as announcing its latest earnings, Lloyds released forecasts for house prices.\nThe group said it expected house prices to rise by 1.5% in 2024 and average that amount over the next four years.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Heathrow Airport reported a huge rise in profits before tax of £189m for the three months to 31 March after recording a £60m loss for the same period last year.\nThe UK's biggest airport said some 18.5 million passengers travelled through it in early 2024, partly driven by growth on business routes to Delhi and Mumbai in India and strong North American traffic.\nIt has predicted this summer will be its \"busiest on record\", adding it had \"a robust operating plan in place to keep the airport running smoothly, even if unnecessary industrial action materialises\".\nHoliday firm Jet2 also said its summer season was 55% sold so far, with forward bookings for package holiday customers up by 13% and flight-only passengers up by more than 18%.",

And to share the screen and the box office with a huge film like Barbie, that also deals with the experiences of women, it's got to be a good thing.\" \nPart of the reason There's Still Tomorrow might have struck such a chord in Italy, however, is that the heroine, Delia, (also played by Cortellesi) suffers violent physical and emotional abuse by her husband. In the film, Delia is a housewife and mother living in poverty in post-war Rome in 1946, the year Italian women first got to vote.\nHowever, the film's story resonates with contemporary Italian audiences. According to recent police statistics, 120 women were murdered in Italy in 2023, about one every three days. The report said just over 50% of them were killed by partners or ex-partners. A quarter of them were killed by their children - in 89% of those cases, their son.However, the film's story resonates with contemporary Italian audiences.

A \"brief groping\" become a trend on Instagram and TikTok in Italy, along with the #10secondi hashtag.\n\"The subject of the killing of women is unfortunately very, very topical, especially in Italy,\" Cortellesi explains. \n\"But femicide is often the tragic end of something that didn't begin that way. What we don't know is the history that culminates in a horrendous act of violence and a death of a woman every 72 hours in Italy. We can only infer a history of violence which is often not even brought to the authorities before it escalates.\"\nThe director says that the themes of violence against women has been part of her scriptwriting for years, as well as in her stage and screen work as an actor, although she says she hasn't personally experienced it herself.\n\"I wanted to make a contemporary film set in the past in order to compare what's changed and what's stayed the same,\" she explains.\n\"We might now, as women, have certain rights and safeguards, but what hasn't changed in society is this mentality that distorts love and turns it into possession. That's why we need better education.\"\nThere's Still Tomorrow may be set in 1946, shot in black and white (a nod to classic Italian filmmakers of the period) and tackle a subject like domestic violence, but an ironic humour still pervades the story, something the filmmaker says she believes helped audiences relate to it.\n\"When I've written scripts in the past, I've used this same kind of language,\" she says. \"It's not comedy per se, it's using the language of comedy to talk about some very serious themes. I feel that by using humour you can usher in these topics. You know that people are going to hopefully empathise and take the side of your heroine, without me being confrontational in my cinematic language.\"\nWhen There's Still Tomorrow first premiered in Italy, English-language industry publication Screen Daily called it \"a sentimental tale of suffering and self-sacrifice\", adding that Cortellesi \"executes it with style\". \n\"The domestic violence… is at times, choreographed into a grotesque and startling dance,\" said Screen Daily critic Allan Hunter, adding: \"The more overblown romantic moments are undercut by… dry humour\".\"The domestic violence… is at times, choreographed into a grotesque and startling dance,\" said Screen Daily critic Allan Hunter, adding: \"The more overblown romantic moments are undercut by… dry humour\".\nOld-fashioned word of mouth is credited for the film's longevity and financial success, as well as the filmmakers taking the film on to regional towns and cities and holding extensive Q and A sessions alongside the film. \nCortellesi claims that 45% of her audience demographic in Italy were men, which she calls \"a great joy\".\n\"This was never meant to be a film against Italian men, it's an invitation to share and walk together down the same path in life. I really didn't want to alienate men from watching the film and think I was pointing an accusing finger at them. \n\"I think because of the tone of the movie and the way all the different characters were portrayed, men actually identified with the female characters, I could see it in the way they reacted during the film.\n\"A lot of men felt able to speak up in the Q and A sessions afterwards, and share their own stories, which I often found really moving.\"\nUltimately though, the actress and director calls her 11-year-old daughter her \"muse\" for the film, and says it could be described as \"a mother-daughter love story\".\n\"This whole project happened because I was reading her a book about women's rights, and my daughter couldn't believe that a time existed when our rights weren't in enshrined in law. So it occurred to me we needed to talk to younger generations that they have to realise their rights aren't a given,\" she says. \n\"Just because we achieve something, it doesn't mean it's going to be there forever.  I wanted, in a way, to start passing the baton to a younger generation.\"\nThere's Still Tomorrow is released by Vue Cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 26 April 2024.",

        "content": "Rebel Wilson is an international movie star best known for her roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect. Here's what you need to know about the Australian actress. \nShe grew up in the suburbs of Sydney, where her parents were professional dog handlers, breeding beagles in their garage.\nThe Australian's first TV gig was for a show called Burke's Backyard, which ran for 17 years from 1987. One episode featured the Wilsons' family pets and Rebel as an extra. \nAfter high school at age 19, Wilson went to Africa as a youth ambassador but caught malaria in rural Mozambique. While recovering in hospital, she had hallucinations about winning an Oscar. \nWhen she returned to Australia, Wilson told family and friends that the \"malaria vision\" had convinced her to pursue a career in acting.   \nWilson was rejected five times from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art, according to the New York Times.  \nWhen she arrived in Hollywood, Wilson auditioned for almost 30 screen roles before being cast in Bridesmaids - a 2011 comedy blockbuster that made her a household name. She originally auditioned to play Melissa McCarthy's character, but film-makers decided to add her to the script as a second room-mate alongside British comedian Matt Lucas. \nThe Australian actress became widely adored by fans for playing roles like \"Fat Amy\" in Pitch Perfect, a movie franchise starting in 2012 in which she starred as a hilarious and eccentric member in the Bellas singing group.\n\"I love doing those roles, I love those characters, but then I did want to do more things,\" Wilson has said. \"I felt like being the bigger girl, you're just more pigeon-holed.\"\nBy the end of 2019, Wilson had one of the most financially successful years of her life, earning more than $20m (£16m) for Pitch Perfect 3, Isn't It Romantic and The Hustle - Hollywood movies in which she played very similar characters. \nIn 2020, Wilson told her agent she wanted to do a \"year of health\", but she claims people around her pushed back, saying she would lose the edge that made her successful. \"The agency liked me fat because they got hundreds of thousands of dollars in commission for each film where I played the fat funny girl,\" she said.\nWilson lost 80lb (36kg) and shared her physical transformation online, often opening up about past problems with binge eating. She said losing weight showed her how powerful stereotypes still are when some people claimed she could no longer be funny as a slimmer person. The lifestyle change was prompted by doctors who said it would help her chances with fertility treatment.\nAt 20, Wilson was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which can lead to difficulties getting pregnant. She reportedly went through several rounds of treatment before deciding to use a surrogate to carry her baby. Her first child Royce was born in 2022. \nRebel told the BBC: \"I was the classic example of a career woman who went out into the world, didn't even think about kids, and then suddenly in your mid 30s is like, 'Oh, hang on, do I want that as an option?'\"\nThe actress proposed to Ms Agruma, a fashion and jewellery designer, at Disneyland in 2023. The pair were introduced through a mutual friend and started an \"old-fashioned\" texting and messaging relationship before they met in person, Wilson told Vogue.\nIn her new book, Rebel Rising, the star has talked about being a \"late bloomer\" and losing her virginity at 35. It was in the 2022 movie The Almond and the Seahorse that Wilson first kissed a woman, co-actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.\nRebel Rising is a memoir about Wilson's sexuality, weight and fertility. It made headlines when the US version was released because it contained allegations against Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen, who Wilson starred alongside in the 2016 film Grimsby \nThe British edition of the book, published on Thursday, blacked out text believed to be relating to him. A spokesman for Baron Cohen said the redactions represented a \"clear victory\", and reiterated his position that Wilson's claims were \"demonstrably false\".\nPublishers said they moved the UK and Australia release back to \"coincide with Rebel Wilson's press tours\".

There's no mean people in show business.\"People's Esther Kang, who was at the show, wrote: \"Even though Ellen DeGeneres is looking back at her talk show with a sense of humor, she can't deny that her unceremonious exit left deep wounds.\"People's Esther Kang, who was at the show, wrote: \"Even though Ellen DeGeneres is looking back at her talk show with a sense of humor, she can't deny that her unceremonious exit left deep wounds.\"\nKang added: \"After musing about how she became the 'most hated person in America' amid the swirling headlines, DeGeneres said that the ordeal reduced her television persona into a shell of its former glory.\"'The hate went on for a long time and I would try to avoid looking at the news,' she recalled. 'The 'be kind' girl wasn't kind. That was the headline.'\"Noting how she ended her talk show each day by saying, 'Be kind to one another,' DeGeneres joked that it became a 'problem' because people started to think of her as a 'one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced up steps.'\"The comedian also referenced the cancellation of her 1990s sitcom - which occurred after she came out as gay.\n“For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business…Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,\" she said. She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has \"been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem\".\"There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,\" she added.The stand-up show ended with a question and answer session - with one audience member saying they had been inspired by DeGeneres' ability to bounce back after a recent tough period.It’s hard to dance when you’re crying,” DeGeneres said. “But I am dancing now.”",

Kay said he \"can't believe\" the new delay, which is \"very disappointing\".\nHis shows will now happen next month, as will a gig by US rock band The Black Keys that had been scheduled for Saturday, 27 April.\nKay said: \"My apologies once again but unfortunately the Co-op Live still isn't ready and so, as yet, remains untested for a large-scale audience. Consequently, they are having to reschedule my two shows yet again (I know I can't believe it either).\"\nHe added: \"It's very disappointing but your safety is very important, and I won't compromise that.\"\nKay's poster on social media originally said he would open \"Europe's biggest new arena\" and would be the \"first artist in the world to perform at Manchester Co-op Live\".\nAfter the second postponement, he jokingly changed that to say he \"is hoping to eventually perform at Europe's biggest new arena*\" - with the asterisk referring to a note saying \"if they actually open the place\".After the second postponement, he jokingly changed that to say he \"is hoping to eventually perform at Europe's biggest new arena*\" - with the asterisk referring to a note saying \"if they actually open the place\".\nAnd after being pushed back in the schedule, it added that he is \"currently the ninth artist in the world to perform at Co-op Live\".\nHe is now due to appear on 23 and 24 May, with The Black Keys rescheduled to 15 May.\nThe latest delay is a fresh blow for the arena, which also had to cancel thousands of tickets to a test event headlined by Rick Astley last weekend.\nThe venue's statement said: \"Since making the difficult decision to postpone the live shows at Co-op Live due to take place this week, we have been undertaking an extensive protocol of testing critical procedures to ensure all areas are ready for fans. \n\"To ensure that we can run all shows safely, regretfully we have now had to take the decision to reschedule the planned The Black Keys and Peter Kay shows. Both The Black Keys and Peter Kay have graciously agreed to reschedule their shows.\"\nThe statement continued: \"We deeply appreciate the impact this will have on excited fans, and sincerely apologise for the inconvenience that this change will undoubtedly cause.\n\"Rescheduling Peter Kay and The Black Keys will give us the extra time we need to continue testing enhanced emergency communications thoroughly. This is vital to satisfy the rigorous set of guidelines and protocols that are necessary for a venue of this size to ensure that our fans, artists and staff have the safest experience possible.\"\nA joint statement from Manchester City Council and the emergency services supported the postponement, saying: \"We all agree that there is more to complete before the venue can welcome audiences safely.\n\"Whilst we understand this will be disappointing, we cannot compromise on public safety,\" they said.\nThe statement added: \"The elements outstanding include a fully tested emergency services communication system, and some remaining internal security systems, and fire safety measures.   \n\"Work is progressing quickly in all of these areas, and all partners involved look forward to the venue being open and able to welcome guests safely once they are completed.\"\nThe arena, which will have a maximum capacity of 23,500, is now due to open next week with a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, followed by the first two nights of pop star Olivia Rodrigo's UK tour.\n\"Today's announcement comes with reassurance that we welcome fans to Co-op Live from Boogie Wit Da Hoodie on 1 May and into Olivia Rodrigo from 3 May 2024,\" the venue added.\nTake That, Keane, Elbow, Eric Clapton and Barry Manilow are among other stars lined up to perform there in the coming weeks.\nHarry Styles is among the investors in the venue, which is next to Manchester City's Etihad Stadium.\nThe arena has been built by City Football Group, owned by billionaire UAE royal and deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour; along with Oakview Music Group (OVG), co-founded by US music mogul Irving Azoff.\nIt is sponsored by the Co-op Group, and a spokesperson said: \"As the naming rights sponsor for Co-op Live, we are very disappointed in the delayed opening of the venue and fully recognise the disruption this has caused to affected ticket holders, many of whom are Co-op Members.\n\"Co-op Live is an incredible venue and is a force for good for Manchester, our region and the UK as a whole. We look forward to seeing the venue fully open in accordance with the timescales provided by OVG today.\"",

        "content": "The first grand opera to be produced in Saudi Arabia has had its opening performance in Riyadh - part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's massively ambitious plans to shift the kingdom into a new era, economically and socially.  \nZarqa Al Yamama is the story of a blue-eyed tribal matriarch with the gift of foreseeing the future in pre-Islamic Arabia. \nHer predictions of imminent danger are ignored by her tribe - a story with a universal resonance according to Ivan Vukcevic, head of Arabian Opera. The company was set up in Switzerland to help develop the performance and teaching of classical music in the Middle East.  \n\"At its core lies the central female heroine with an extraordinary gift of foresight, advocating for reason and love in the face of adversity, even at the expense of her own life,\" he says. describing it as an epic tragedy familiar to many in the Arabic-speaking world.\nWhen the idea of a lavish new opera in Arabic was first presented two years ago, Mr Vukcevic and his company were initially taken aback and puzzled.\nThey wondered how the Arabic language, which is written from right to left, could be integrated into Western classical music notation which goes from left to right. But the standardised romanisation of Arabic helped resolve the issue.  \nThe Arabic libretto has been written by Saudi poet Saleh Zamanan, while the music is by Australian composer Lee Bradshaw.\n\"The brief, as I understood it, was this was to be a Western opera with an influence of Arabic and particularly Saudi music,\" Mr Bradshaw explains. \nHe said he used the rhythmic quality of Mr Zamanan's poetry as the basis for the music.\n\"I actually began the whole process by doing a rhythmic dictation of every line of poetry that we used in the opera. And that became the basis for the setting of all the vocal lines. And from there I sort of worked top down to orchestrate,\" he said.\nBritish opera singer Dame Sarah Connolly is playing the title role of Zarqa Al Yamama and says she had sleepless nights worrying about singing in Arabic. She spent months working with a Saudi language tutor.\n\"I felt listening to Lee's music that he's really beautifully made it recognisable using lots of Arabic sounds that they'll be used to hearing in popular music, various… musical tropes, recognisable modalities, and so on, and all instruments that they'll have heard before, like the Ney flute and the oud guitar,\" she said.\nPaolo Petrocelli, who is currently head of Dubai Opera, has played a key role in developing the art form in the Middle East and says that the creation of Zarqa Al Yamama is part of a wider trend in the region.\nHe says the wider Gulf region has \"witnessed a remarkable evolution in opera theatre\" that reflects a growing appreciation for performing arts. Investments in state-of-the-art venues and cultural initiatives have seen the region become a \"dynamic hub for opera\" that is able to attract top talent and stage immersive productions, he says.\n\"This development underscores the region's commitment to fostering artistic expression and enriching its cultural landscape.\"\nThere are opera houses in Cairo, Damascus, Muscat and Dubai and Saudi Arabia is also building a state of the art opera house as part of the redevelopment of the historic Diriyah district in Riyadh. \nThe Saudi investment in developing its cultural heft in the region and beyond matches similar efforts in sport and other sectors. And there's no doubt that there has been a genuine transformation - by no means welcomed by all Saudis - in many aspects of day-to-day life in the country.\nIn offices, universities and entertainment venues, Saudi men and women now mix freely, with no morality police to impose once strictly observed gender segregation. \nRiyadh now hosts months of lavish entertainment each year, attracting the biggest stars in the Arab world and beyond, in contrast to a decade or two ago when any public performance was vanishingly rare. Middle Beast, a huge rave event, takes place regularly on the outskirts of the Saudi capital - it's all now part of the fabric of Saudi society.\nConservative elements in the country have bemoaned the changes, while the less well off are to some extent excluded by ticket prices. Tradition remains powerful in the kingdom too, meaning that many young Saudis, particularly women, have yet to participate in this new Saudi Arabia.\nBut the new Saudi Arabia has also been accompanied by widespread suppression of dissent, with long prison sentences meted out to a number of Saudis who have expressed criticism on social media. \nAnd the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.And the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.\nThere's been plenty of controversy over the decision by world famous sporting celebrities, like Portuguese football star Ronaldo, to play in Saudi Arabia. Human rights groups have denounced it as \"sportswashing\" - using major sporting events or stars to divert attention from a country's conduct. Similar accusations have been made over stars in entertainment and culture. \n\"If Saudi Arabia is truly committed to 'social reforms', then the starting point should be investing in education, schools, healthcare, and basic human rights for people below the poverty line, among other necessities,\" says Maryam al-Dossari, a Saudi activist.\n\"While opera, cinema, and musical festivals are welcomed, they should not be the primary focus and merely designed to attract Western attention.\"\nSarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the human rights group Dawn - which was founded by Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed - is even more scathing.\n\"The Saudi government's all-out promotion of the country as a liberal, modern country with events like this opera show stand in such stark contrast to its cruel and repressive rule in the country,\" she said.\n\"It wants to be seen as a progressive government by dressing up as a progressive government without actually behaving like a progressive government.\"\nFor his part, composer Mr Bradshaw believes that the benefits music brings can transcend politics.  \n\"We came here probably 18 months ago to do some auditions and we saw hundreds of young Saudis auditioning for extra roles, for dancers, for acrobats, all manner of things, musicians,\" he said. \n\"And it was really amazing to speak to some of them who communicated very clearly to us that some of them never thought that they'd have an opportunity to do anything like this. And that really just galvanised in my mind the fact that we absolutely have to come here and do this. \n\"I think it's important that culture goes everywhere in the world because it is the strongest unifying force that we've got.\"",

I have to walk out.”After their chance meeting in 1981, the duo started making demos in a studio off Camden Road, paid for by Tennant's job at Smash Hits magazine.“Our ambition was simply to make a record with [New York dance producer] Bobby O, and for it to be available on import in the Record Shack shop on Brewer Street,” he says.They achieved their goal. Tennant was sent to New York to interview Sting, and used the opportunity to introduce himself to Bobby O. He agreed to release West End Girls on his own label, and it became a minor club hit in the US and Germany. By the end of 1984 it was available on import in London, and when the band re-recorded it two years later, it went all the way to number one.“Radio stations jumped at it because they knew the original and they were eager to play it,” says Tennant.“And once you've started on this journey you want to carry on with it.”\nFifty million record sales later, the band are about to release their 15th studio album, Nonetheless, which marks a return to the maximalist sound of their heyday, after three records of what Tennant calls “electronic purism”.Strings grace every track, from the soaring love song Feel to the stately groove of Love Is The Law.A sense of hope and possibility infuses the record - paradoxically so, given that it was written during the Covid lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.“I’d just moved into a new house and I felt quite euphoric about it, really. \"Dancing in my kitchen, walking in the countryside... The pressure of our life had been removed.”Isolated at home, the duo traded demos over email. Tennant even downloaded GarageBand and learned to record his own vocals for the first time.\nWith time to spare, he also re-recorded some of the folk songs he’d written as a teenager.“It's amazing you could remember them,” Lowe marvels. “Hadn't you ever put them onto a tape recorder?”“Yes, but I don’t have the cassettes any more,\" Tennant replies. \"I just think, if the songs are any good, you can remember them.”There are “no plans” to release those nascent tunes, he adds, indicating he'd rather keep them as personal mementoes.Nonetheless, Nonetheless contains several flourishes of acoustic guitar - and one song that specifically references lockdown (Why Am I Dancing?, which finds Tennant shuffling around the kitchen, alone but happy, as the music swells around him).Elsewhere, he writes about whatever takes his fancy. There's a ballad about Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nuryev “jumping the barrier at Orly Airport” to claim asylum; and a song written from the perspective of Donald Trump’s reluctant bodyguard. “If my number’s up, I’ll take a bullet for Narcissus.” “If my number’s up, I’ll take a bullet for Narcissus.” A recent study suggests pop lyrics have become simpler and more self-obsessed since the Pet Shop Boys' 1980s imperial phase.

So what do The Pet Shop Boys make of her oeuvre?\n“I'd be very interested, if I'm still alive, to see how Taylor Swift is regarded in years to come,” says Tennant, “because she has this massive success - but normally with people with massive success, there's a popular legacy of songs that everyone knows.“If you're Michael Jackson, who doesn’t know Billie Jean or Beat It? With Taylor Swift I never feel it's the moment where your grandmother knows her song.”Is that simply a function of our fractured media age, I ask? Swift has to compete with the noise of social media and TV-on-demand and streaming services where 100,000 songs are uploaded every day.Is that simply a function of our fractured media age, I ask? Swift has to compete with the noise of social media and TV-on-demand and streaming services where 100,000 songs are uploaded every day.“But we all know Harry Styles’ As It Was,” argues Lowe.“I know it, and I’m old enough to be a grandmother,” Tennant adds.“I know it, and I’m old enough to be a grandmother,” Tennant adds.“Speaking as a grandmother, you are aware of Harry Styles,” laughs his bandmate.“Speaking as a grandmother, you are aware of Harry Styles,” laughs his bandmate.\nThis isn’t a criticism of Swift, they stress. After all, Tennant isn’t averse to personal lyrics when the occasion demands.Take, for example, New London Boy. One of their album’s most beguiling songs, it finds the singer reminiscing about his arrival in the capital, 51 years ago.Synths shimmer like a flashback sequence as he describes leaving his “invented life” in Newcastle and “unlocking the secret of me” on the city’s streets.“Are they girls or boys? Is everyone gay?” he wonders, his eyes opening to a new life. “Am I just kidding myself [that] I’ll go all the way.”“Are they girls or boys? Is everyone gay?” he wonders, his eyes opening to a new life. “Am I just kidding myself [that] I’ll go all the way.”“Going all the way’, is a sexual reference,\" he explains, \"but it’s also about my ambitions to be a singer\".\"And in those days I had a girlfriend, so it’s about bisexuality a bit as well.”He’s described the song as “what happens between verses two and three of Being Boring”, the classic PSB single about partying in London with his childhood friend, Chris Dowell, who later died of Aids-related illnesses.He’s described the song as “what happens between verses two and three of Being Boring”, the classic PSB single about partying in London with his childhood friend, Chris Dowell, who later died of Aids-related illnesses.\nThe wistful and evocative atmosphere of New London Boy is ruptured by a spoken-word section, where Tennant describes the threat of violence that stalked the gay community in his youth.“Newcastle was terrifying in the 70s,” he says.“The only time I’ve ever been punched was by a skinhead, when I was waiting for a bus. I brought that paranoia down to London with me.”He took solace from the story of a drag queen who was attacked outside Newcastle’s Eldon pub in the 1970s. Alert to danger, she'd come prepared, and sent the skinheads scattering by wielding a handbag that concealed a hefty brick.“I like the idea that someone would fight back,” says Tennant, “but I’ve still never had a handbag of my own.”Today, his encounters with the public are much more genteel. The Pet Shop Boys have an \"acceptable level\" of fame, where they can catch the tube or cycle through their second home in Berlin without being harassed.“We’re always out on the street, so if someone says, ‘Oh, can I get a selfie?’, I'm generally very surprised,” Tennant says. “I sort of forget that I'm me!”That won’t be a luxury he can enjoy for the rest of 2024.As well as the new album, the Pet Shop Boys have extended their ongoing Greatest Hits tour, written a musical based on The Emperor’s New Clothes, and will stage their third residency at London’s Royal Opera House in June.They love playing there – relishing the opportunity to turn Covent Garden’s citadel of high culture into a throbbing nightclub, even if it doesn’t make financial sense.“We could make five times more money playing the O2 arena for one night,” Tennant observes.\nShortly after the residency, the singer reaches his milestone 70th birthday.  Has he ever considered retiring?“It's not on the agenda, per se,\" says Tennant, \"but who knows?\"“The touring gets a bit much,” Lowe points out, archly suggesting their next tour will be called \"Farewell, given how long this one's gone on\".But the Pet Shop Boys show no signs of slowing down. Songs are being written, concepts are frothing up, and there is lunch to be had.A debate ensues: Get sandwiches now, or at the record label this afternoon?Tenant is happy to drop into Pret A Manger (although he vetoes the BBC tagging along, after we suggest the headline “Pret Shop Boys”) but the offer of salmon-on-rye from Danish eaterie Ole & Steen is potentially more tempting.Tenant is happy to drop into Pret A Manger (although he vetoes the BBC tagging along, after we suggest the headline “Pret Shop Boys”) but the offer of salmon-on-rye from Danish eaterie Ole & Steen is potentially more tempting.The conversation continues out of the studio and into the bowels of the BBC. The band shun the lift, however, leaving just one exit option: A spiral staircase.“Ugh, I hate these,” says Lowe. “Never again.”",

        "content": "From Richard Curtis classics to the so-bad-they're-good movies, the world is not short of romantic comedies.\nDespite this, a new rom com musical about two twentysomething strangers meeting ahead of a wedding has impressed critics.\nTwo Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York) sees optimistic brit Dougal (Sam Tutty) arrive in the city for his absent father's second wedding. At the airport he is met by native New Yorker and sister of the bride, Robin (Dujonna Gift).\nWith wedding bells ringing in the distance and the glitz and glamour of the big apple all around them, it's not hard to guess what happens during Dougal's 36-hour whirlwind trip, but it isn't as plain sailing as you might imagine. \nIn a five-star review, Theatre Weekly's Greg Stewart said the play \"cleverly steers its narrative away from the traditional rom-com structure and instead gives us an immensely touching story of how two people who have never met can have a profound impact on each other\".In a five-star review, Theatre Weekly's Greg Stewart said the play \"cleverly steers its narrative away from the traditional rom-com structure and instead gives us an immensely touching story of how two people who have never met can have a profound impact on each other\".\nSpeaking to the BBC on opening night, Gift and Tutty, both aged 26, said they relate to their characters to the point that \"sometimes it doesn't even feel like we are acting\".\n\"Just like our characters, we don't have it all figured out and I think I am similar to Dougal in the sense that I can sometimes use optimism to hide my true feelings, which is a very British thing to do,\" said Tutty who plays a bouncy Brit who, despite never having been to New York, feels like he knows the city after watching Home Alone 2 and Ghostbusters. \nTime Out's Caroline McGinn awarded the show four star and particularly praised Tutty, who won an Olivier in 2020 for Dear Evan Hansen.Time Out's Caroline McGinn awarded the show four star and particularly praised Tutty, who won an Olivier in 2020 for Dear Evan Hansen.\n\"He brings the sweetness and floppiness of early career Hugh Grant, but relies less on cringey posh diffidence and more on a sweet theatricality,\" she wrote.\nThe show touches on themes that young people may find particularly relatable - from terrible Tinder dates to having an existential crises about what it means to be happy.\n\"I really hope young people come and see this show because it is so important and it really can change someone's life,\" explained Gift, whose character Robin is a jaded barista who is at the mercy of her Bridezilla older sister Melissa. \nAsked about the current debate over high ticket prices in the West End, the actress said: \"I think it's really disappointing that so many people don't have access to the theatre because of price or location and it shouldn't be seen as a luxury.\"\nThe hit musical, written by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, first premiered at London's Kiln Theatre in 2023 to rave reviews.\nIn a four star review, the Telegraph's Marianka Swain called the show a \"total charmer\" which had \"all the ingredients to be an irresistibly sweet treat\". In a four star review, the Telegraph's Marianka Swain called the show a \"total charmer\" which had \"all the ingredients to be an irresistibly sweet treat\". \nThe writers told the BBC that it took eight years to perfect and was a tribute to rom coms. \n\"We watched so many rom coms for inspiration,\" Buchan explained. \"We realised that actually these films do have an impact on relationships and if you watch them enough it can change your love life for better or worse.\"\nIn a separate review for London Theatre, Swain praised Barne and Buchan for having \"crafted a sharp modern update to the Richard Curtis-esque Transatlantic meet-cute, adding welcome spice to that treacly recipe\".In a separate review for London Theatre, Swain praised Barne and Buchan for having \"crafted a sharp modern update to the Richard Curtis-esque Transatlantic meet-cute, adding welcome spice to that treacly recipe\".\nAlong with soaring ballads and upbeat sarcastic tunes, it's the razor sharp lyrics that stay with you the most.\n\"There must be a decent available guy somewhere inside this phone!\" sings Robin desperately during a song about Tinder dating, while Dougal mocks the creepy and predatory lyrics of Christmas Songs like Baby It's Cold Outside. \nTwo Strangers is just one of many quirky musicals that have recently hit London's West End in the hope to reach new audiences. \nAt the Olivier Awards in April, Operation Mincemeat, which tells the true story of secret mission that won Britain WWII, picked up the award for best new musical. It comes after the show had its run extended eight times and will now play until November 2024. \nLater this year, a whodunnit parody musical, produced by the team behind Phoebe Waller Bridge's Fleabag, will open on the West End.\nKathy and Stella Solve a Murder! will run for several months at the Ambassadors Theatre after being a hit at the Edinburgh fringe festival.\nOther brand new musical comedies to hit the West End in the coming months include Jack Godfrey's pop ode to being a teenager, Babies.",

He has two children with ex-wife Billie Piper.\nAhead of Thursday's ruling, Mr Fox described the original judgement as a \"bullies charter\" and said he disagreed \"profoundly\" with the result.\nHe vowed to appeal in a post on X and said: \"You get the same wonga if you lose a leg at work.

        "content": "Taylor Swift's latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, has topped the UK charts with the biggest first-week sales in seven years.\nThe 31-track double album shifted 270,000 UK chart units in seven days, eclipsing her previous personal best of 204,000 for her 2022 album, Midnights.\nThe last time an album sold more in its first week was in 2017, when Ed Sheeran's Divide sold 670,000 copies.\nSwift now matches Madonna as the female artist with the most UK number ones.\nBoth stars have achieved 12 chart-topping albums in their career. Only four acts can claim more - The Beatles (16), The Rolling Stones (14), Robbie Williams (14) and Elvis Presley (13).\nBruce Springsteen also has 12 number ones, meaning Swift has also drawn level with The Boss.\nThe Tortured Poets Department was released last Friday as a 16-track standalone album. Two hours later, Swift surprised fans by issuing a second volume, titled The Anthology, containing 15 extra tracks.\nTaken as a whole, the project is a voyage through two tumultuous years of the star's personal life, as she has navigated heartache, criticism and the trappings of fame.\nIt was met with mixed reviews. Pitchfork's Olivia Horn said Swift was \"largely retreading old territory\", an accusation echoed by Rolling Stone's Larisha Paul, who said the star was \"going through the motions while running in place\".It was met with mixed reviews. Pitchfork's Olivia Horn said Swift was \"largely retreading old territory\", an accusation echoed by Rolling Stone's Larisha Paul, who said the star was \"going through the motions while running in place\".\nThe same publication's Rob Sheffield disagreed, calling the album a \"wildly ambitious... cathartic confession\" that could be the star's \"most personal album yet\".

Helen Brown in the Independent agreed: \"The whole album is a terrific reminder of the intense, personal connection Swift can conjure in song.\"\nFans either didn't mind about any lukewarm reviews or didn't care. The album has broken dozens of records in its first week of release. Here is a round-up of them:\nBy the end of Friday, The Tortured Poets Department had become Spotify's most streamed in a single day.\nFive days later, it was streamed for the billionth time - the first album ever to achieve that feat.\nNo other artist has notched up a dozen number one albums in the UK so quickly. \nSwift took 11 years and six months, starting with Red in October 2012. This surpasses The Beatles, who managed the feat in 14 years and one month between Please Please Me (May 1963) and The Beatles At Hollywood Bowl (June 1977).\nIn the US, Tortured Poets is projected to sell more than 1.8 million copies this week. \nOf those, 700,000 of those sales were on vinyl - breaking Swift's own record for the largest sales week for an album on vinyl since modern tracking began in 1991.\nHer previous record, of 693,000, was set just six months ago, with the release of 1989 (Taylor's Version).\nFortnight, which features guest vocals from Post Malone, is the both the first single and the first track on The Tortured Poets Department.\nLast Friday alone, it was streamed 25.2 million times - breaking the record for the song with the most plays in a single day.\nThe previous record was set on Christmas Eve 2023, when 23.7 million people played Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You.\nIn its first six days, Tortured Poets racked up 799 million streams across all platforms in the USA.\nThat easily surpasses Drake's previous record of 746 million with his 2018 release, Scorpion.\nIn the UK singles chart, Swift also holds the number one position this week with Fortnight. Two other Tortured Poets songs make the top five - with the title track at number three and Down Bad at four.\nSwift is stopped from having more entries in the Top 40 by a rule that only allows three songs from one artist to chart at the same time.\nIt was introduced in 2017 after all 16 songs from Ed Sheeran's album ÷ (Divide) charted inside the Top 20. It was introduced in 2017 after all 16 songs from Ed Sheeran's album ÷ (Divide) charted inside the Top 20. \nThe Official Charts Company says the limit means that newer artists aren't starved of the opportunity to get noticed.\nLast week's number one, Too Sweet by Irish singer Hozier, has dropped one place to number two. Sabrina Carpenter's prospective summer anthem Espresso has risen one place from number six to complete the top five.",

        "description": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. ",
        "content": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. \nA hole in the ozone layer - the protective barrier of gas in the upper atmosphere - now lingers over the frozen continent for more of the year.\nA major cause of ozone loss is believed to be the amount of smoke from unprecedented Australian wildfires, which were fuelled by climate change. \nThe study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. The study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. \nClimate change biologist Prof Sharon Robinson told BBC News: \"When I tell people I work on the ozone hole, they go: 'oh, isn't that better now?'\"  \nScientists working in Antarctica discovered the hole in the ozone layer in 1985 - by measuring the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth. \nA large group of ozone depleting chemicals were responsible - primarily CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons - that were used as refrigerants. Every country agreed, in 1987, to phase out a group of ozone-depleting chemicals. It was an agreement known as the Montreal Protocol and is considered to be the most successful environmental treaty in history. \nThe ozone layer is now healing. \"But there's a hole - an area where the ozone layer is very depleted  - that appears every spring over Antarctica,\" Prof Robinson explained.\nThat ozone loss is particular to the polar continent, because of chemical reactions that occur in very low temperature, high atmospheric clouds. Those reactions break down ozone - eating a hole in the layer.     \nThe annual appearance of this hole usually peaks in September and October, when most land-based plants and animals are safely tucked away under snow cover and marine animals are protected by extensive sea ice.\nIt is now lasting through to December - well in to the Antarctic summer. \"That's when things will be exposed and most vulnerable,\" said Prof Robinson. \nCertain types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, called UV-B rays, increase the risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans, but researchers do not yet know if the same is true for Antarctic mammals and birds.\nIt's likely that anything covered by fur and feathers - seals and penguins - would be protected, explained Prof Robinson. \n\"But probably the biggest risk to the Antarctic animals is eye damage.\"\nIn their paper, Prof Robinson and her colleagues combed through all the studies they could find about the effect of UV on Antarctic plants and animals. \nThey found evidence of Antarctic mosses synthesising their own protective \"sunscreen compounds\". \n\"And if they're putting energy into sunscreen, they're putting less energy into growing,\" said Prof Robinson. \"There's always a cost to sun protection.\" \nThere is also evidence that krill - the small and hugely abundant marine creatures that are the foundation of the Antarctic food chain - move deeper into the ocean to avoid UV rays, which could affect the whales, seals, penguins and other seabirds that feed on them. \n\"We also know that the phytoplankton that the krill feed on will have to make sunscreens in order to avoid damage, said Prof Robinson. \nOne major reason for the longevity of the ozone hole is the vast scale and extent of Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020. \nJim Haywood, who is Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Exeter, told BBC News that the record duration of the Antarctic ozone hole over recent years was \"a wake-up call\". \n\"Society cannot be complacent about our achievements in tackling it,\" he said.\nBut there are still a number of factors that are delaying ozone recovery, including wildfires and major volcanic eruptions - these release particles that fuel the ozone-eating reactions that have already done so much damage. \nProf Robinson explained that some proposed climate-cooling experiments - so-called geoengineering - propose \"making clouds\" by releasing particles into the upper atmosphere. \n\"That would also deplete ozone, so it's a bad idea,\" she said. \n\"The biggest thing we can do to help Antarctica is to act on climate change - reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible so we have fewer bushfires and don't put additional pressure on ozone layer recovery.\"\nFollow Victoria on X, formerly Twitter",

Dubai International Airport, the second busiest in the world, was forced to cancel hundreds of flights. At least 20 people died in Oman and four in the United Arab Emirates when the storm hit on 15 April. Dubai International Airport, the second busiest in the world, was forced to cancel hundreds of flights. \nIt happened after months of hotter-than-average sea surface temperatures partly caused by El Niño - which is when warm waters rise to the surface of parts of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe higher ocean temperatures added more moisture to the atmosphere, making heavy rainfall more likely.\nThe scientists also concluded that cloud seeding - the manipulation of clouds to create more rain - did not have \"significant influence\" on the flooding. \nScientists internationally agree that climate change from burning coal, oil and gas is driving up global temperatures and causing more extreme weather including storms.\nBut it can be harder to say specific events, like a single storm, are caused by climate change because of variability in weather patterns. \nTo find out the answer, scientists look at years of information about weather in a place to identify trends. They also use computer models to compare a world without global warming to the world we live in now with 1.2C of warming since pre-industrial times. \nWithout lots of data, like rainfall information, it can be harder to see patterns and come to strong conclusions.\nBut the basic physics of global warming remain the same and indicate that a hotter atmosphere will create more powerful storms and rainfall, explains Professor Friederike Otto from Imperial College London.\n\"We are quite confident about the link to climate change. Studies by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) show future increases in rainfall intensity in the region,\" she explained. \nProf Otto also said that this study was among the hardest done by the World Weather Attribution group because of gaps in data.\nThe way that cities have been built in the Gulf also made the impacts of the storm on humans more powerful, says Roop Singh from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\nCities built without adequate storm management combined with very dry soils in the region that struggle to absorb excess water means that 85% of people in UAE live in flood-prone areas.",

        "content": "A giant 3D printer, which is big enough to make a house, has been unveiled at the University of Maine. The university says it has beaten its own record for the world's largest polymer 3D printer - with the new printer four times bigger than the previous machine.The Factory of the Future 1.0 (FoF 1.0) can print objects 96ft (29m) long - approximately the length of a blue whale.But experts say, despite the breakthrough, most of us will continue to live in homes made of bricks and mortar.\nLarge 3D printers, such as that unveiled in Maine, are more like to be used to make parts of houses rather than full homes, says Dr Eujin Pei, who is an expert in additive manufacturing at Brunel University.He says they can be used for historical restoration, \"not to print a house, but sometimes to print decorative parts, or sometimes to restore some parts.\"They may become useful after natural disasters to manufacture parts of destroyed buildings, he told the BBC.Maine University says it hopes the printer can be used to make affordable housing, as well as bridges, boats and wind turbines.It can print up to 500lbs (227kg) of material per hour.While 3D printers often print using plastic, the university hopes to include more sustainable materials and prioritise recycled polymers. Maine is also home to large forests - and the hope is to use residual wood from sawmills as material to feed into the printer.\"The downside is that those kind of materials are not so durable,\" says Dr Pei.Wood is \"not so robust, but it's more environmentally friendly,\" he says.The 3D printing process saves on time and waste by only using the materials needed, but there are still some environmental impacts.\"Sometimes the materials being used are not fully being able to be recycled because of contamination\" in the production process, Dr Pei adds.However, as products are designed on a computer first, their energy efficiency can be calculated beforehand - and they can be printed in a way which takes less time.\"There are definitely cost savings with respect to energy efficiency [and] resource efficiency,\" says Dr Pei.\nPartly funded by the US military, the giant printer in Maine uses \"sensors, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence\" to help manufacture large products, said Habib Dagher, who is head of the university's Advanced Structures and Composites Center.

        "content": "The disruption and isolation of lockdown had a particularly profound impact on children with special needs, many of who did not receive the support they required. Some schools are now struggling to help pupils who find it difficult to cope. \nLockdown turned out to be very bad news for 14-year-old Erin, from Oldham.\nShe was in the last year of primary school at the time of the first lockdown. The experience affected her confidence massively.\n\"Before Covid, I'd never imagined feeling uncomfortable doing anything, I was always the first one to say 'I'll do that', now I don't dare do anything.\" \nAt the time Erin enjoyed being confined to one class, feeling like it was a safe space.\nBut when education returned to normal, she struggled at her new school, Newman Roman Catholic College. \"I get really overwhelmed with all the noises and the crowds. I cannot deal with crowds - it really stresses me out.\" \nErin had already been diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia, but an assessment for autism was put on hold during the pandemic. \n\"It delayed diagnosis, we missed the opportunity to get additional support and that has had a big impact on her,\" says her mum, Cheryl.\nBefore Covid, 16 children at the school were on Education, Health and Care (EHCP) plans which set out additional support given by the local authority for special educational needs. Now the figure is 53. \nIn addition there are 176 children like Erin who need extra learning support but do not qualify for an EHCP, so the school must fund them out of its existing budget. \nFor those with an EHCP, the first £7,000 comes from the school budget before the local authority can offer more. \nAcross England 353,995 EHCPs were issued in 2019, but in 2023, after the pandemic, the number had risen to 517,000. The number of pupils with SEN support without an EHC Plan now stands at 1,183,384.\nErin fell behind at school, and started to get into trouble. She regularly walked out of class, and then refused to return.\n\"I was quite a nightmare, I was out of control. One of my mates literally had to sit and do my work in my lessons because I wouldn't do it,\" she says.\nCheryl said she would get frantic phone calls and text messages from Erin, often from the school toilet, asking for her to come and take her home. \"It was hard. It was really hard, I felt like a failure as a parent,\" she says.\nStaff say the school has worked hard to address the problems of Erin and the other pupils with special needs. There is a safe space - called The Link - where pupils can spend their breaks and lunchtimes away from crowds. \nErin is in smaller classes - known as nurture groups - for most lessons, and staff established a pass system to allow her to leave school and take a break when things got too much.\nErin has also had sessions with the local Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to improve her behaviour and self-esteem that has made a \"massive, massive difference\". \nBut despite this Erin has only managed to be in school for a couple of days a week for the last few years.\n\"If I walk in the room and there is a test I'm walking back out of it, I can't do it. I need a week to prepare myself.\"\nPupils like Erin, who go to school in the most-deprived areas - more than a third of pupils at Newman qualify for free school means - are much more likely to be persistently absent than those who attended schools in the least-deprived areas. A third have missed at least 10% of sessions so far this academic year.\nRebecca Ashworth, who plays a leading role in Newman's safeguarding, has to deal with hungry children who ask for food, and severe incidents of self-harm which result in a trip to A&E.\nShe says her job is \"more stressful\" than her old position in front-line social work.\n\"There is so much more put on schools post-Covid. We have definitely seen an increase in mental health concerns and safeguarding concerns across the board,\"  she says.\nShe said the support services to which pupils are referred are also incredibly stretched. Although the school has an NHS CAMHS mental health practitioner who sees five children one day a week, they can only deal with pupils who pose a low-level risk.\nWith 1,500 children in the school, Rebecca says there is no way that needs can be fully met, and across Oldham 409 children are waiting for a neuro-development assessment. \nMaggie Holland, who works at the school providing mental health support, says problems with pupils' self-esteem have never been worse. Since Covid she has drop-ins at breaktime and lunchtime, and staff do morning \"meets and greets\" with pupils with social anxiety who do not attend school to try to persuade them to return. \nShe says family breakdown during Covid have exacerbated problems for children who found themselves in the middle of conflict. She also noticed that children's eating habits had changed during lockdown, with some either bingeing or not eating at all.\nMaths specialist Sam Gray, Newman's head of behaviour, says the school had \"the worst behaviour we've ever seen when we got back after Covid\". However, it has worked hard on how best to deal with students, tightening up the existing systems and responses to behaviour. \nFor instance, being late to lessons is an automatic detention, but new rewards have also been introduced, including celebrating a Newman hero every week. \nStaff have undergone a lot of retraining too, but there is only so much they can do.\n\"We can't educate 1,500 to the level we want whilst dealing with a huge amount of personal and societal crisis,\" he says. \n\"It's like we're just burying our heads and keeping going without ever taking a step back and thinking society has changed [post-Covid] and how are we going to change with that.\n\"There's a lack of trust from parents of anyone in power and I do think that comes from Covid. \n\"We've got really good relationships with our parents, we're building that up again, but that's taking time, that's taken three years.\"\nHead teacher Glyn Potts says the forced pause on normal school life during Covid should have presented an opportunity to create a better system fit for the future - but it was not taken. \n\"We tinkered around the edge and tried to recreate what we had before moving forward, and that was such a missed opportunity.\n\"And now more schools are operating within that framework when the world has changed.\n\"We're dealing with issues and expected to do more when the resources and the infrastructure are not there - yet we're still finding a way of making it work.\" \nA Department for Education spokesperson said schools should have sensitive conversations with families and work closely with them to put in place support for children with special educational needs.\n\"Thanks to our fantastic teachers and school leaders, and our package of wide-ranging reforms designed to support schools to improve attendance, 440,000 fewer children were persistently absent or not attending last year,\" they said.\nListen to more on this story on 5 Minutes On on BBC Sounds.Listen to more on this story on 5 Minutes On on BBC Sounds.",

        "content": "Dejected. That's how Jey Sushil, a student at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, says he feels. \nMr Sushil is still shaken by the death in February of fellow student Amarnath Ghosh, a 34-year-old classical dancer from India. Local police are investigating it as a homicide case.\nMr Sushil says he found out about Ghosh's death through a friend in India before receiving any information from his university.\n\"They told us after two days. Students are not very happy with the overall response. It's like, who cares about how Indians feel?\" \nGhosh was fatally shot off campus in a city street. The university clarified that it communicates a student's death only after law enforcement confirms the identity, a process that takes time, and with consent from the student's next of kin. \nCalling it a \"horrible tragedy\", the VC of Marketing and Communications at Washington University in St. Louis, Julie Flory said, \"We shared this sad news with members of our community as soon as we could and according to the wishes of Amarnath's closest contacts.\"\nThe St. Louis Police Department said it \"takes 48 hours to establish identity\" of the deceased and \"in many cases, much longer\".\nGhosh is among the 11 Indian or Indian-origin students who have died in the US so far this year, sparking fears about personal safety within the community. \nThe causes of death have varied, from hypothermia to suicide to shooting. Experts say there is no discernible link between these unrelated incidents. As each tragedy echoes through campuses, students carry on with their daily routines, balancing fears amid academic demands.\n\"We avoid going out after dark. We have identified places in the city that are unsafe in the evenings. What else can we do?\" Mr Sushil asks. \nLike him, others also complain that their universities do not report the deaths on time, and they find out about them through Indian media or from relatives back home. \nMohammad Abdul Arfath, 25-year-old student of Cleveland State University (CSE), was found dead earlier this month after he went missing in March.\nA student, who wanted to stay anonymous and joined the college at the same time as Arfath, said he found out about his death through a WhatsApp message from his parents. \n\"My parents reminded me that I have to stay on guard,\" he said.\nNearly 267,000 Indians enrolled in US universities in 2022-23 and the number is projected to reach a million by 2030. \n\"The desire, the draw or pull of an American degree is very strong in India and appealing to Indian families,\" says Rajika Bhandari, a New York-based education expert.\nSangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University in New Jersey, says there is no \"clear pattern\" that connects the deaths and that \"it's important to not fall into the trap of building an overarching narrative that it's happening because they're Indians\".\n\"I haven't seen anything which suggests that these are cases of racial hostility or attacks based on race.\"\nIndian parents say they try to maintain regular contact with their children.\n\"It scares us whenever we hear such kind of news sitting far away in India,\" says Meenu Awal, whose son studies at the University of Southern California.  \nMs Awal says that she's instructed her son to \"not retaliate\" even in a case of a robbery. \"I have told him to just give cash or whatever, and walk away.\" \nNeetu Marda from Jaipur city says she talks to her daughter at New York University every day and keeps her friends' phone numbers handy. \"I ask her not to go out alone with unknown people.\"\nStudents at different campuses also follow their own safety protocols.\nAnushka Madan and Ishika Gupta, co-presidents of the Association of South Asians at Tufts University in Massachusetts, say they have a set of common safety rules, which includes not walking alone on campus at night.\n\"Boston is generally pretty safe,\" Ms Gupta says. \"But we stay a bit more cautious right now, more aware of our surroundings.\" \nAlong with physical safety, universities are aware of the psychological impact on students.\n\"It's become clear that international students are increasingly facing mental health issues which are a combination of immense financial pressure and academic pressure to keep up their level so that their visa status is not affected,\" says Ms Bhandari, the education expert. \n\"It's a huge psychological burden when they're thousands of miles away from home.\"\nOthers note that the students, hailing from varied economic and cultural backgrounds, experience their time abroad differently.\n\"International students face unique stressors when they leave their support systems and navigate a new culture,\" says Reena Arora-Sanchez, executive director of communications at CSU.\nThe Indian embassy in the US offers guidelines for students to contact them and hosts regular online and in-person open house sessions.\nAt Georgia Institute of Technology, Pratham Mehta, the president of the India Club, says they've reached out to the institute's \"large Indian student population\".\nThere are various on-campus therapy services available, and the club also facilitates connections to the Indian consulate for students feeling unsafe. Additionally, CSU provides an app linking students to the university's police department and offers a free safety escort service for campus and nearby student housing.\nExperts say that security and law enforcement have always been an important factor for students while choosing colleges. \nIn February, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said, \"We are very committed to making sure that Indians know that the United States is a wonderful place to study and to be safe.\"\nBut the recent spate of deaths have brought the issue into sharper focus.\nAmerican universities know that there is a \"huge and growing appetite among Indian students to study abroad\", Ms Bhandari says. \"Institutions are in a tough place trying to capitalise on this interest but at the same time, there's a clear acknowledgement that there are very real concerns around personal safety.\" \nDespite uncertainties, the US remains a sought-after destination for students.\nSwaraj Jain from Jaipur is heading to New York University in August, brimming with excitement and a clear understanding of the challenges ahead.\n\"Everyone talks about gun violence and crime. I will have to be careful,\" he says. ",

It moved beyond the bubble of gas emitted by the Sun - a domain known as the heliosphere - in 2012, and is now embedded in interstellar space, which contains the gas, dust and magnetic fields from other stars. \nA corrupted chip has been blamed for the ageing spacecraft's recent woes.\nThis prevented Voyager's computers from accessing a vital segment of software code used to package information for transmission to Earth.\nFor a period of time, engineers could get no sense whatsoever out of Voyager, even though they could tell the spacecraft was still receiving their commands and otherwise operating normally.\nThe issue was resolved by shifting the affected code to different locations in the memory of the probe's computers.\nVoyager-1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager-2.\nThe pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989.\nThey were then steered towards deep space, in the general direction of our galaxy's centre.\nTheir power comes from radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which convert heat from decaying plutonium into electricity. The continual decay process means the generators produce slightly less power each year.\nHow much longer the Voyagers can continue is uncertain, but engineers have until now always come up with strategies to eke out a few extra years of operations.  \nVoyager-2 is a little behind its twin and moving slightly slower.\nIt's just over 20 billion km (13 billion miles) from Earth.\nEven though both are travelling at over 15 km per second (9 miles/s), they would not approach another star for tens of thousands of years.",

        "content": "Conservation actions are effective at reducing global biodiversity loss, according to a major study.\nInternational researchers spent 10 years looking at measures, from hatching Chinook salmon to eradication of invasive algae.\nThe authors said their findings offered a \"ray of light\" for those working to protect threatened animals and plants.\nOne out of every three species monitored is currently endangered because of human activities.\nIn the first study of its kind, published in the journal Science, scientists from dozens of research institutes reviewed 665 trials of conservation measures, some from as far back as 1890, in different countries and oceans and across species types, and found they had had a positive effect in two out of every three cases.\nCo-author Dr Penny Langhammer, executive vice-president of environment charity Re:wild, told BBC News: \"If you read the headlines about extinction these days, it would be easy to get the impression that we are failing biodiversity - but that's not really looking at the whole picture.\n\"This study provides the strongest evidence to date that not only does conservation improve the state of biodiversity and slow its decline, but when it works, it really works.\"\nThe success stories include:\nIn one out of every five cases, however, the measures had caused the targeted species to decline. \nBut Dr Langhammer said: \"One of the most interesting findings was that even when a conservation intervention didn't work for the species that is was intended, other species unintentionally benefited.\"\nCreating marine protected areas for Australian seahorses, for example, had meant more of them were eaten as their natural predators' populations had increased.\nIt is normal for species diversity and populations to fluctuate - but the rate of extinction is now 100-1,000 times faster than scientists would expect.It is normal for species diversity and populations to fluctuate - but the rate of extinction is now 100-1,000 times faster than scientists would expect.\nClimate change, habitat loss and the spread of invasive species are believed to be driving this. \nSo if conservation was working, co-author Dr Joseph Bull, University of Oxford associate professor in climate-change biology, told BBC News, \"these measures are clearly not being funded at a sufficient scale to actually start to reverse global declines in biodiversity\".\nIn 2022, almost 200 countries signed the Global Biodiversity Framework, agreeing to halt the decline in nature by the end of the decade. In 2022, almost 200 countries signed the Global Biodiversity Framework, agreeing to halt the decline in nature by the end of the decade. \nThey set a target of mobilising at least $200bn (£160bn) per year from public and private sources.\nBut only an estimated $121bn a year is currently being invested in conservation worldwide.But only an estimated $121bn a year is currently being invested in conservation worldwide.\nUniversity of Sussex environmental-biology professor Dr Fiona Matthews, who was not involved in the research, said it showed \"conservation interventions can and do work\". \nBut she added: \"I was struck by the lack of representation of countries in the Global South in the analysis, with only a handful of papers from biodiversity hotspots of sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, and South East Asia. \n\"This, sadly, is a reflection of academic publishing, funding and research, rather than a failure on the part of the authors.\"\nHalf the trials the researchers assessed had been in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. \nDr Bull agreed and said the next stage of research would look at other areas of the world but \"one thing I would say is that it's very clear that that doesn't change the results\".",

        "content": "A leader of students protesting the war in Gaza at Columbia University has apologised after video emerged of him saying \"Zionists don't deserve to live\".\nKhymani James, 20, said he was \"unusually upset\" and \"misspoke in the heat of the moment\".\nOn Friday, Columbia announced that he had been banned from campus.\nProtests which began at Columbia in New York City have since spread to campuses across the US.\nMr James, who has acted as a spokesman for the protesters, posted the comments to Instagram in January. He also said: \"Be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.\"\nThe comments were made both before and after Columbia administrators called him in for a disciplinary hearing.\n\"I don't fight to injure or for there to be a winner or a loser, I fight to kill,\" he said in a post. \nIn recent days, those comments were circulated by pro-Israel activists. \nOn Friday Mr James apologised, writing in a statement on X: \"I affirm the sanctity of all life and the movement for liberation.\"\n\"All people deserve to be safe from physical harm.\"\n\"Calls of violence and statements targeted at individuals based on their religious, ethnic, or national identity are unacceptable and violate university policy,\" the university said in a statement.\nA spokesman for the White House issued a statement condemning his remarks about Zionists.\n\"These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. \n\"It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews.\"\nSome of the campus protests on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism, and President Biden earlier this week condemned the \"antisemitic protests\".\nA number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. \nOn Friday, the Columbia University Senate, made up of faculty and students, voted to admonish the university administration for its handling of the protests. \nCalling city police in to clear the encampment ran \"contrary to the norms and traditions\" of the university, the senate said. \nColumbia President Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik is facing pressure to step down over the response to the protests.\nThe latest wave of campus protests began after Columbia officials called in police to clear a protest encampment on 18 April and more than 100 people were arrested.\nActivists have been calling for universities to \"divest from genocide\" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza.\nIsrael is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as \"baseless\".\nAmong the recent developments:\nThe war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 34,180 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nAre you a student in the US?

        "content": "An important trial of the world's first \"personalised\" mRNA vaccine against the deadliest form of skin cancer - melanoma - is now under way in the UK. \nSteve Young, 52, from Stevenage, Herts, who had a melanoma growth cut out of his scalp last August, is one of the first patients to try the shot. \nIt is designed to help his immune system recognise and wipe out any remaining cancerous cells. \nAnd hopefully, that means his cancer will not return. \nThe jab, mRNA-4157 (V940), uses the same technology as current Covid vaccines and is being tested in final-stage Phase III trials.  \nUniversity College London Hospitals (UCLH) doctors are giving it alongside another drug, pembrolizumab or Keytruda, that also helps the immune system kill cancer cells.\nThe combined treatment, made by Moderna and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD), is not yet available routinely on the NHS, outside of clinical trials. \nExperts in some other countries, including Australia, are also trying it on patients, to gather more evidence and see whether it should be rolled out more widely. \nThe vaccine is personalised - meaning the make-up of it is changed to suit the individual patient. \nIt is created to match the unique genetic signature of the patient's own tumour and works by instructing the body to make proteins or antibodies that attack markers or antigens found only on those cancer cells.\nUCLH investigator Dr Heather Shaw said the jab had the potential to cure people with melanoma and was being tested on other cancers - lung, bladder and kidney tumours.\n\"This is one of the most exciting things we've seen in a really long time,\" she said.\n\"It is absolutely custom built for the patient - you couldn't give this to the next patient in the line because you wouldn't expect it to work.\n\"It's truly personalised.\n\"These things are hugely technical and finely generated for the patient.\"\nThe UK part of the international trial aims to recruit at least 60-70 patients across eight centres, including in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Leeds.The UK part of the international trial aims to recruit at least 60-70 patients across eight centres, including in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Leeds.\nThe patients on trial must have had their high-risk melanoma surgically removed in the last 12 weeks to ensure the best result. Some of them will get a dummy or placebo shot rather than the vaccine. None of them know which they are receiving though. \nMr Young is having his treatment in London. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 Today Programme, he said: \"[The trial] gave me a chance to feel like I was actually doing something to fight a potential unseen enemy.\n\"Scans showed I was radiologically clear, obviously there is still the chance I had cancer cells floating around undetected. \n\"So rather than just sit there and wait and hope it was never going to come back, I actually had this chance to get involved in putting on some boxing gloves and squaring up to it.\"\nThe musician had a lump on his scalp for many years before realising the growth was cancer. He said being diagnosed was a \"massive shock\". \n\"I literally spent two weeks just thinking 'this is it',\" he said.\n\"My dad died of emphysema when he was 57 and I actually thought 'I'm going to die younger than my dad'.\"\nCommon signs of melanoma to check for include:\nThe ABCDE checklist can help identify if a mole is abnormal:\nThese changes won't always be cancer, but it is important to get checked.\nThe earlier a melanoma is picked up, the easier it is to treat and the more likely treatment is to be successful. \nPhase II trial data, published in December, found that people with serious high-risk melanomas who received the jab alongside the immunotherapy Keytruda were almost half (49%) as likely to die or have their cancer come back after three years than those who were given only the drug.\nDr Shaw said there was real hope the therapy could be a \"gamechanger\", particularly as it appeared to have \"relatively tolerable side effects\".\nThese include tiredness and a sore arm when the jab was given, she said, adding that for the majority of patients it appeared no worse than having a flu or Covid vaccine.",

        "content": "A satellite operated by Japanese company Astroscale has chased down a 15 year-old piece of space junk and taken an up-close image of it.\nThe object is a discarded rocket segment that's about 11m by 4m (36ft by 15ft), with a mass of three tonnes.\nIt's the first time anyone has managed to rendezvous with so big a piece of space debris.\nAstroscale is developing a business that would offer to remove others' redundant hardware from orbit.\nIt won't do it on this occasion; the current mission is all about testing the sensors and software needed for safe proximity operations. But a determined effort to pull a lump of junk out of the sky should occur in the next couple of years, the firm says.\nThe issue of orbital debris and the sustainable use of space is becoming a hot topic right now.\nMillions of items of techno-detritus have accumulated overhead since the start of the space age in 1957 - from flecks of paint to the abandoned upper-stages of rockets, like the one just pictured by Astroscale.\nThis wandering swarm of metal and other materials runs the risk of colliding with, and destroying, the functional satellites we use to communicate and monitor the planet.\nRocket bodies are a particular hazard because of their immense bulk. \nThe one in the new image came from Japan's H-IIA launch vehicle, which lofted a CO2-measuring spacecraft called Gosat, in 2009.\nThe upper-section of the rocket ejected Gosat at an altitude of roughly 600km.\nBut whereas more modern rockets make sure all their parts come back down to Earth soon after a flight, this H-IIA stage stayed up there. And it's far from being alone.\nThe European Space Agency has counted 2,220 rocket bodies still in orbit today.\nAstroscale calls its rendezvous mission Adras-J, or Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan.\nIt's being performed by a smart spacecraft that was launched on 18 February. The satellite has been closing in on the H-IIA body ever since. \nAdras-J used cameras and algorithms to make the final approach. Great care is needed not to bump into the rocket segment, which is slowly turning end over end.\nAstroscale's UK employees built the \"ground segment\" for the mission, which is the system used to communicate with Adras-J. They've also done much of the \"flight dynamics\" work, which is all about precise navigation.\nAround-the-clock operations have been shared by Mission Control in Tokyo and the company's British base at Harwell in Oxfordshire.\nThe plan is to spend the coming weeks taking more imagery and gathering information on the rocket segment, such as the condition of the structure, its spin rate, and spin axis.\nAdras-J will will attempt to fly around the rocket body in the process.\nFuture Astroscale missions will move in and grab hold of their quarry with the aid of robotic arms. \nOn this occasion, Adras-J will limit itself to an experiment in which it will try to slow the tumbling rate of the rocket stage. \nThe activity will involve firing thrusters at the body in a direction opposite to its spin motion. The pressure of the thrusters' plume ought to decelerate the rotation rate.\nA number of companies around the world are developing technologies similar to Astroscale. \nExperts say that to prevent a cascade of collisions in orbit, it's imperative space-faring nations start removing several large pieces of junk every year.",

More than a half of girls said they had drunk alcohol in the past 30 days.\nHarriet Strange, 30, from Kent started drinking alcohol when she was 14. \n\"My dad was an alcoholic so I think there's a chance that I may have done it because it was learned behaviour from him,\" she said.\n\"Once I started drinking it was a spiral of self-destruction.\n\"My friends were always older than me so I would get them to buy alcohol for me or I would take it from my house.\"\nHarriet would go to house parties when she was 14 or 15 and \"nobody would bat an eyelid, it was just normal\".\nShe said she knew from an early age that her relationship with alcohol wasn't like other people's.\n\"It got to the point where I wanted to drink vodka at school,\" she said.\n\"My father's death when I was 16 was really the catalyst of absolute self-destruct.\"\nShe has been sober for three-and-a-half years now and credits becoming pregnant with her daughter for saving her life.\n\"I know what it's like being a child of an alcoholic and I didn't want to give that to her.\"\nHarriet is now a recovery coach and volunteer for Nacoa, an organisation which provides support for those affected by a parent's drinking.\nHelena Conibear, from Talk About Trust, which educates children in schools about alcohol and other substances, said most children have their first drink in the family home.\n\"If teens think parents don't mind, they will drink outside the home,\" she said.\nOfficial health advice is that children and young people should not drink alcohol before the age of 18 and, if they do, not until at least 15. This is to protect their brains and their bodies, which are too young to cope with it.Official health advice is that children and young people should not drink alcohol before the age of 18 and, if they do, not until at least 15. This is to protect their brains and their bodies, which are too young to cope with it.\nThe report also looked at other substances used by adolescents.\nOn cannabis use, the report found more boys in Scotland had used the drug (23%) compared to all other countries surveyed. \nCannabis use has dropped and stabilised in recent years but some vulnerable children are still continuing to use it, said Dr Inchley.\nNo data on cannabis was provided for England.\nSmoking among children is much less common than it used to be - one in five 15-year-old girls said they had ever smoked a cigarette - but smoking rates are still higher among girls than boys in England and Wales. \nThe report confirmed that vaping rates have overtaken cigarette smoking in most countries, with nearly one in 10 11-year-olds saying they've used a vape at least once, rising to 26% of boys and 40% of girls by age 15.\nVaping rates in the UK are above average, compared to other countries. Even though vaping is thought to be much less dangerous than smoking, the risks of children breathing chemicals into their lungs are not yet fully understood. \nThe UK government has already introduced measures to clamp down on the promotion and illegal sale of vapes to under 18s. \nDr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said harmful substance use among children in many countries was \"widespread\" and \"a serious public health threat\".\nHe said children were constantly exposed to harmful products online and that video games were helping to make drinking, smoking and vaping seem acceptable and normal.\nThe report urged countries to introduce measures to protect younger generations, such as limiting the availability of nicotine and tobacco products, alcohol and a ban on advertising and promotion of any substances on mainstream and social media.",

        "content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned Washington will act if China does not stop supplying Russia with items used in its assault on Ukraine.\nSpeaking to the BBC in Beijing, the US's top diplomat said he had made clear to his counterparts they were \"helping fuel the biggest threat\" to European security since the Cold War.\nHe did not say what measures the US was prepared to take.\nBut Mr Blinken was also keen to stress progress had been made in some areas.\nHe praised Beijing for making efforts in stopping supplies of the drug fentanyl reaching the US.\nChina remains the principal source of fentanyl for the US, which the White House has said is causing a public health crisis across the country.\nMr Blinken also stressed he felt Beijing can play a \"constructive\" role in the Middle East, pointing towards China using \"its relationship with Iran to urge\" against further escalation in its confrontation with Israel.\nThe visit - the second in 10 months made by Mr Blinken - forms part of a significant increase in dialogue and diplomacy between these rival powers as they attempt to put relations on an even keel after a period of immense tension last year.\nRelations between Washington and Beijing have been strained by China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and US export bans on advanced tech. They were further damaged by a row over a spy balloon last February.\nIn recent days, the US passed a law that would force Chinese-owned TikTok to sell the hugely popular video app or be banned in America - something Mr Blinken earlier revealed had not come up in his meeting with China's President Xi Jinping.\nMr Xi - who met Mr Blinken on Friday afternoon in Beijing's Great Hall of the People - agreed the two sides had \"made some positive progress\" since he met his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November.\nHe added the countries should \"be partners, not rivals\", saying that if the US took \"a positive view of China's development\", relations could \"truly stabilise, get better and move forward\".\nMr Blinken told the BBC that one of the key routes for \"better relations\" between China and both the US and Europe would be for Beijing \"or some of its enterprises\" to stop providing \"critical components\" that help Russia make more munitions. The components include items such as \"machine tools, micro-electronics, and optics\".\n\"It's helping Russia perpetuate its aggression against Ukraine, but it's also creating a growing threat to Europe because of Russia's aggression,\" he explained, adding it was \"helping to fuel the biggest threat to [Europe's] insecurity since the end of the Cold War\". \n\"We've taken action already against Chinese entities that are engaged in this,\" he said. \"And what I make clear today is that if China won't act, we will.\"\nMr Blinken - who hinted at sanctions as a possible route - was keen to stress that China was not directly supplying Russia with weapons.\nIn his interview with the BBC, Mr Blinken said it remained important to see if the two countries could \"build greater cooperation in areas where we have mutual interest\", including artificial intelligence and military communications.",

        "content": "The Pentagon says it will \"rush\" Patriot air defence missiles and artillery ammunition to Ukraine as part of its new military aid package. \nThe US will utilise $6bn (£4.8bn) for this purpose, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin revealed on Friday.\nHowever, Patriot systems for launching the missiles will not be sent.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Patriots were \"urgently\" needed to face a growing Russian air threat and \"can and should save lives right now\". \nA source confirmed to the BBC that the $6bn was part of a $60bn aid package signed into law by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, which also includes $1bn in more immediate aid. \nMr Austin told a news conference that the US was committing to its largest security assistance package to date and would \"move immediately\" to get the supplies to Ukraine. \nThese would include air defence munitions, counter-drone systems and artillery ammunition but not Patriot missile systems. \n\"It's not just Patriots that they [the Ukrainians] need, they need other types of systems and interceptors as well,\" Mr Austin said. \"I would caution us all in terms of making Patriot the silver bullet.\" \nHe added that he was confident that more of the missile systems would be made available for Kyiv soon. Conversations were ongoing with European partners, he said, to deliver additional capabilities.\nThe Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, said the assistance should eliminate the Ukrainians' need to ration shells on the frontline.\nSome of the latest funding would also go to building up Ukraine's own defence industry, so that it can start manufacturing more of the ammunition it desperately needs. \nMr Austin said Russia had already increased domestic production of artillery ammunition and other weapons - as well as being propped up by supplies from Iran and North Korea.\n\"Understand what's at stake for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the United States,\" he said. \"If Putin prevails in Ukraine - Europe would face a security threat it hasn't seen in a lifetime. Russia will not stop in Ukraine.\"\nAsked whether the US aid would protect Ukrainian forces, Mr Austin said that the commitment was \"material, real, and substantial\" although \"not instantaneous\". \n\"It's going to take some time to get it in there and distribute. The Ukrainians were able to hold - with this capability, they can do a lot better.\"\nThe defence secretary's words come as Ukraine warned on Friday that Russia was ramping up attacks on its railways ahead of a fresh offensive.\n A Ukrainian security source told the AFP news agency that Moscow wanted to damage Ukrainian railway infrastructure to \"paralyse deliveries and movement of military cargo\".\nUkraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300. \nThey are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. \nGermany has already promised an extra Patriot system - and its defence and foreign ministers appealed to their European counterparts earlier this month to respond urgently.\nGreece has stocks of Patriots and S-300s but said none could be spared. \n\"We explained why we cannot do it,\" Greek  Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis told Skai TV.\nHis said his country's air defences were \"critical systems for the protection of Greek air space\".\nAccording to reports, Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system. \nRecent months have seen Kyiv step up its calls for Western assistance as its stocks of ammunition are depleted and Russia makes steady gains.\nUkrainian officials have blamed delays in military aid from the US and other Western allies for the loss of lives and territory.",

        "content": "An orphan orca calf that has been trapped in a lagoon for more than a month off the coast of British Columbia is finally free.\nThe orca had been stuck since 23 March after its mother died, sparking a huge rescue effort off Vancouver Island's west coast.\nRepeated efforts to coax or carry her out a narrow path to open water were unsuccessful.\nBut on Friday, the calf managed to swim out on its own thanks to high tide. \nThe escape marks a happy ending for the Ehattesaht First Nation, who led the rescue efforts and affectionately named the whale Kwee-sa-hay-is, meaning Brave Little Hunter.\nThe two-year-old female calf had been stuck in the tidal lagoon after her pregnant mother was stranded and later died on a sandbar. The lagoon is near the coastal village of Zeballos, located on a narrow inlet on Vancouver Island that flows out to the Pacific Ocean. \n\"Today the community of Zeballos and people everywhere are waking up to some incredible news and what can only be described as pride for the strength this little orca has shown,\" said Chief Simon John in a statement on Friday. \nChief John said the orca swam away at 02:30 local time (8:30 BST), \"during high tide on a clear and glass-calm, star-filled night\". \nThe 15-year-old mother's death was captured on video in March, and repeated attempts to save her at the time were unsuccessful. \nFor weeks after her mother's death, the young calf had been unwilling to swim through the narrow channel and under a bridge into open water, prompting a team of First Nations community members and federal marine mammal experts to come together to work on freeing her. \nThis led to several fruitless rescue missions. In one attempt, rescuers tried to catch the orca and move her using a sling. In another, they tried to communicate with her using recorded whale sounds to convince her to move.\nAt one point, a violinist from Nanaimo, BC tried to serenade the calf in a bid to entice her to swim away. \nChief John said protective measures are now being put in place to shield the calf from boats or humans in the area.\nThe focus now, he said, is on reuniting her with her family. \n\"Every opportunity needs to be afforded to have her back with her family with as little human interaction as possible,\" Chief John said.\nIn a briefing, with fishery officials and First Nations representatives, they said she was recorded emitting excited sounds after leaving the lagoon. \n\"It was incredible how vocal she was when she hit that deep open water,\" one said. \nOfficials say the young orca has a proven track record of successful hunting. She has been observed eating herring and birds while trapped in the lagoon. \nThe hope now is that she will be reunited with her pod, or find a pod containing relatives who might adopt her. \nA statement from the First Nations community said her successful escape will resonate for years to come and that it  reinforces understanding of the connections between humans, animals and the Earth. \n\"Events like these have a deeper meaning and the timing of her departure will be thought about, talked about and felt for generations to come,\" the statement said.",

        "content": "A Canadian province will recriminalise the use of hard drugs in public, partly rolling back a landmark policy meant to help tackle a deadly opioid crisis.\nBritish Columbia's decriminalisation project began in January 2023 as a three-year pilot programme. \nBut it has faced pushback over concerns around public disorder and drug use. \nPolice will soon have the power to again address drug use in all public places, including hospitals, restaurants, parks and beaches.\n\"While we are caring and compassionate for those struggling with addiction, we do not accept street disorder that makes communities feel unsafe,\" provincial Premier David Eby said in a statement announcing the change on Friday.\nIt is unclear when the new rules will come into force. The province said it is working with the federal government to \"urgently\" change the policy. \nBC is the only province in Canada where the hard drug decriminalisation pilot programme is underway. \nThe project allows adults to possess up to 2.5 grams of heroin, fentanyl, cocaine or methamphetamine without being arrested, charged or having their drugs seized, initially except around schools and airports.\nThe pilot is to run until 2026.\nBut under the new rules announced on Friday, police will now have the power to ask a drug user to leave an area, and seize their drugs, or arrest them \"in exceptional circumstances\". \nIt would not affect people using drugs in a private home or at supervised consumption or drug-checking sites.  \nMr Eby's government had initially tried to pass a law that expanded the public places where drug use was prohibited to include not just schools and airports but playgrounds and near homes and businesses.\nThat effort was blocked by the province's top court late last year over concerns it would cause \"irreparable harm\" to people who use drugs.\nMuch of North America is grappling with a deadly opioid drug crisis. \nFatal overdoses peaked above 112,000 in the US for the first time last year, while BC marked its own grim milestone of more than 2,500 deaths in 2023. \nThe deaths are fuelled by a toxic street drug supply laced with fentanyl and other products, of which a small amount can be fatal.\nBut decriminalisation has faced heavy scrutiny in BC after stories emerged of open illicit drug use in places like public parks and hospitals.\nPolitical opponents have called it a \"harmful experiment\" implemented without safeguards for the public - one that has \"utterly failed\" to reduce overdose deaths.\nIn testimony before a federal parliamentary committee this month, Vancouver's Police Deputy Chief Fiona Wilson said that police have been limited in their ability to respond to \"problematic drug use\". \n\"So, if you have someone who is with their family at the beach, and there's a person next to them smoking crack cocaine, it's not a police matter,\" she testified.\nIn April, the US state of Oregon reversed a decriminalisation policy that had been in place since 2020. \nThe policy was seen by many as the most liberal effort in the US to decriminalise hard drugs. \nLawmakers backtracked after overdoses continued to spike in the state and amid pressure from the public over people openly using drugs on streets, sidewalks and in front of stores.",

I don't know when.\"\nTrump campaign adviser Chis LaCivita responded on X/Twitter: \"Ok, let's set it up!\" \nTraditionally, election-year presidential debates have been organised by a nonpartisan commission and scheduled in the autumn. \nLast November the commission announced the three 2024 presidential debate locations - at universities in Texas, Utah and Virginia - with dates set for September and October.\nMr Biden had not committed to those debates before his remarks on Friday, saying in March that his willingness to appear on a stage with Mr Trump \"depends on his behaviour\". \nThe president's comments on Friday came with no advance notice from his campaign and may have been made off the cuff.\nIn recent weeks, Mr Trump and his campaign representatives had been pressing Mr Biden to debate earlier and more often than those scheduled by the debate commission.\nAt a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump appeared on stage near an empty lectern displaying a placard that \"anytime, anywhere, anyplace\".\nMr Trump's tactic represents somewhat of a reversal, as both he and Republican officials had previously accused the debate commission, which also selects debate moderators, of being biased in favour of Democrats.\nThe Republican National Committee withdrew its involvement with the debate commission in April 2022, raising doubts about whether the Republican nominee would participate in 2024.\nThe former president declined to appear at any of his party's five primary debates this election cycle, held between August and January, pointing to his polling lead as evidence that Republican voters clearly supported his campaign and that debates were not necessary.\nHe went on to win all but one of the Republican nomination contests and became the party's presumptive nominee by March.Mr Biden and Mr Trump debated twice during the 2020 presidential campaign. \nThe first was particularly contentious, with the then-president frequently interrupting Mr Biden and debate moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News.\nA third debate was scheduled, but Mr Trump withdrew after it was changed to a virtual event because of Mr Trump's coronavirus diagnosis, which came shortly after the second debate.\nThe first televised US presidential debate was held between Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy in 1960 and is largely credited with helping Kennedy win the White House.\nThea two major party candidates have debated at least once every presidential election year since 1976.",

        "content": "This is the first time that Buckingham Palace has said anything officially about the King's condition since revealing his cancer diagnosis.\nSo it's a significant moment, breaking the silence with a positive message about his treatment and announcing, if not a complete return to good health, then at least the first green shoots of recovery.\nThere has been so much terrible news for the royals this year - the Princess of Wales as well as the King facing cancer - that this must feel like a badly needed change.\nLike the picture of the King and Queen in Buckingham Palace's gardens, there's a touch of summer after a long bleak winter.\nThe dramatic Buckingham Palace statement, which more or less came with its own drum roll, has created a much more optimistic mood. \nKing Charles is going to resume the type of big engagements that he's had to cancel all year.\nAnyone who has gone on a royal visit will have seen how much encounters with the public cheer him up, he's often shaking hands and swapping jokes with those he meets. He does literally seem to want to be a hands-on monarch.\nSuch encounters with ill health can readjust people's views and priorities and it will be interesting to see how it will affect the King. He's a thoughtful and deeply spiritual figure, who will now have another type of adversity to consider. \nIt's not a coincidence that his first visit next week will be to a cancer treatment centre where, with plenty of personal shared experience now, he will show his support for staff and patients.\nThe latest news suggests the King is well enough to host a state visit too, with the Emperor and Empress of Japan arriving in late June - an event which would usually involve the full royal red carpet treatment. These are the soft power moments where the King, as head of state, plays a pivotal role.\nThe last state visit was by the South Korean president and it showed the King's willingness to be creative with diplomacy, including having the band outside Buckingham Palace play 'Gangnam Style'. That was only before Christmas but it seems like a lifetime ago in royal news.\nRoyal commentator Richard Palmer, who has followed Charles's visits for many years, thinks the King will be keen to get his reign back on course.\n\"The King got off to a tremendous start in the new reign, much better than many royal watchers expected, but his and Kate's health problems have knocked the monarchy off course. He is a workaholic so I'm sure he has missed public-facing duties,\" said Mr Palmer.\nHe'll now have a second chance to start his reign.\nThe timing of the announcement might also have headed off some difficult questions that would soon have been arriving about the King's recovery.\nThere are a number of big royal summer events approaching - such as the garden parties, Trooping the Colour and the D-Day commemorations - which the King would have been expected to attend. There were overseas trips anticipated for the autumn too.\nDespite the latest mood music, there is still no certainty over whether he will be well enough to be at any of these events. \nThat it's not possible to say whether he will be at engagements only a few weeks away might be a salutary reminder that this is still an ongoing problem. There might be optimism, but it's cautious optimism.\nIt's understandable for medical matters to remain private, but when you scratch below the surface of the latest statement, there is still much that remains unclear and unknown.\nThe King's cancer treatment has not stopped and there is still no date set for its conclusion. As many families will have found, living with cancer means living with many uncertainties.\nIt isn't back to business as usual.\nIn terms of the statement issued by palace aides, the positive message will have got ahead of any speculation. It's set the narrative on a much more upbeat direction, with the King's doctors \"very encouraged by the progress made so far\", rather than a drip-drip of cancelled attendances.\nThe photograph of the King and Queen issued alongside has, as intended, sailed straight onto the newspaper front pages. It's a conscious message of cheerful reassurance.\nIt's very much a his-and-hers image, the royal couple sharing a moment. The Queen has been standing in for the King in a way that would never have been expected a few months ago.\nAuthor and historian Sir Anthony Seldon says the photo is \"intriguing\" in how much it focuses on the Queen.\n\"Deliberately or not,\" he says the photo give the impression that the \"rock in the marriage\" is Queen Camilla.\n\"Whether or not he will lean on her even more on his return we will see,\" says Sir Anthony.",

        "content": "Protests against the war in Gaza are now roiling dozens of college campuses across the US, many of them storied and highly respected universities. Why are students pitching tents and refusing to leave? And what, specifically, do they want to achieve?\nTensions quickly flared at American universities after the 7 October attack by Hamas that led to the deaths of around 1,200 people in Israel, and to a retaliatory assault that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.\nBut over the past two weeks, those tensions have boiled over into an uprising that joins the ranks of Occupy Wall Street and the 1980s anti-apartheid movement and evokes memories of the protests against the Vietnam War.\nAs historical comparisons abound, college administrators, law enforcement and politicians are grappling with how to respond to rein in a nationwide revolt in a new era dominated by social media and 24-hour news.\nSince October, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, hunger strikes, and most recently, encampments against the war.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties.They are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties.\nStudent activists say that companies doing business in or with the nation of Israel are complicit in its ongoing war on Gaza - and so are the colleges that invest in those companies.\nUniversity endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. They own shares of large companies from Amazon to Microsoft, and put money into private equity, hedge funds and index funds.\nTo understand what is happening now, look back to last December, when the heads of Ivy Leagues testified before Congress about antisemitism on campus. What was seen as waffling put those officials in hot water, and led to the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania resigning.\nLast week, Columbia president Nemat Shafik - who has faced criticism over her own handling of campus divisions about the war - was in the Capitol Hill hot seat, and staked out a much tougher stance on antisemitism than her counterparts had done.\nWhile she was traveling to Washington and testifying, hundreds of students pitched tents to camp in the centre of the New York City campus, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on university leaders to divest from Israel.\nBy the encampment's second day, the city's police department was called in to break up and clear the protest. More than 100 students were arrested for trespassing, with many suspended and now potentially facing criminal charges.\nThe raid appeared to anger and embolden protesters, with student activists banding together once again on campus, organising through social media.\nWith classes due to end next month and final exams around the corner, these Occupy-style tactics prompted the school to shut down all in-person classes on Monday and urge faculty and staff to work remotely. The protest is ongoing.\nThe escalating crisis at Columbia has now inspired similar encampments at private and public universities in at least 16 states and Washington, DC. They are:\nOn Thursday, in response to its own on-campus protests, the University of Southern California announced it had cancelled its main-stage graduation ceremony for students.\nOfficials said they could no longer host the 10 May event, where some 65,000 students and their guests were expected, citing new safety measures that would be required.\nThey added that the school had received several threats to disrupt the ceremony.\nAsna Tabassum, a Muslim student of South Asian descent chosen by the school as its valedictorian, or highest-performing graduate, had earlier been barred from delivering the event's traditional valedictory speech. The school also cited safety concerns.\nPro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.Pro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.\nNo US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past.\nAs a practical matter, endowment portfolios are often managed by asset managers rather than the universities themselves, and closely protect information about their positions in the stock market. But student activists have argued for greater transparency about these funds, even if they do not make active or direct investments to Israel.\nAnd while divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue, similar to how divestment from fossil fuel companies has galvanised climate activism.\nOrganisers also appear to be taking some inspiration from the 1980s, when college students targeted companies doing business with apartheid South Africa and ultimately forced more than 150 schools to divest from the country.\nThe events of the past fortnight have so far not achieved such success.",

        "content": "When Varsha Sahu accidentally inhaled the screw of her nose pin two months ago, she wasn't too concerned.\nShe thought the pin had gone into her stomach and would naturally pass through her digestive system.\nBut the metal object got lodged in her lung and caused her weeks of discomfort and shortness of breath until finally it was removed by doctors. \nLike most married Hindu women in India, 35-year-old Varsha had been wearing a nose pin since her wedding \"16-17 years back\" as it's considered a symbol of marital status.\n\"I didn't know that the screw had come loose,\" she told the BBC on the phone from her home in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. \n\"I was just chatting and I took a deep breath and I inhaled it. I had no idea it went into my airway. I thought it had gone into my stomach,\" the mother of two teenaged boys added.\nDr Debraj Jash, a pulmonologist at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, who removed the pin from Varsha's lung last month, described her case as \"extremely rare\" - Indian media have reported only two cases in the past decade. \n\"Sometimes we get cases where dry fruits or betel nuts have gone into people's lungs, but most such cases involve young children or elderly people above 80. A woman patient in her 30s is an exception.\"\nVarsha's story came to light when - a month after inhaling the screw - she went to a doctor complaining of a persistent cough and shortness of breath and pneumonia. She initially blamed the breathing difficulties on an earlier injury to her nose. \nWhen medicines didn't help, she consulted a pulmonologist. A CT scan detected the object in her lung and a subsequent chest X-ray showed what it was.\nThe pulmonologist sent a fibreoptic bronchoscope - a tiny camera with forceps - down her airway. But it couldn't grasp the \"sharp shining object\" and failed to pull it out. She then referred the patient to Dr Jash.\n\"We had to counsel the patient first. She was worried about undergoing a second procedure so soon after the first one, but we explained to her that the human body is designed in such a way that there's no place in it for a foreign object,\" he said. \n\"We told her there was no way her body was going to accept it and that if left untreated, her pneumonia would keep getting worse,\" he added. \nDr Jash says he also told her that they may even have to perform an invasive surgery which would involve hiving off a part of her lung. But as it could potentially have long-term complications, he decided to give the fibreoptic bronchoscope another try.\n\"It is extremely difficult to pull out a sharp object with a regular flexible bronchoscope. The object had been in her lung for more than two weeks and tissues had already grown around it. \n\"We had to be very careful because if during extraction, the screw came in contact with the airway - which is very narrow - it could cause injury and lead to a bleeding which could cause a catastrophe.\"\nBut the procedure, which lasted 30 minutes, was successful and Varsha was discharged after four days in the hospital.\n\"She's been back for follow-ups and she's now perfectly fine,\" Dr Jash said.\nVarsha laughs when I ask her if she's gone back to wearing nose pins again.\n\"No way. I could never imagine that something like this could happen, but it did. I do not want a repeat of it.\"",

        "content": "With elections fast approaching in South Africa, the BBC's Nomsa Maseko reflects on 30 momentous years of democracy and how the country has changed since the end of the racist system of apartheid.\nMy mother told me when she cast her ballot on 27 April 1994 that the vote felt like a \"get-out-of-jail card\" - she felt empowered.\nShe was 43 years old at the time - and like millions of other South Africans it was the first time she had voted.\nIt was the culmination of decades of resistance and armed struggle against racist and violent white-minority rule.\nI was too young to vote then, though I was allowed by electoral officials to ink my finger, and I saw what it meant for her and the disenfranchised black majority to be free, to finally choose their own government.  \nIt was tense a few days before the polls with widespread fears of political violence. The whiff of tear gas often filled the air in Kwa-Thema, the township east of Johannesburg where I lived.\nArmoured military vehicles drove past our home several times a day and into the night - where gunshots frequently rang out at a distance. \nThe afternoon before the big day, my friends and I were playing hopscotch in the street when a white truck pulled up full of National Party T-shirts, balls and flags.\nThis was the party that came to power in 1948 and imposed legal segregation along racial lines, known as apartheid, meaning \"apartness\".\nMost of us had never owned a new ball before, so we were excited to be given them for free. But our excitement was short-lived.\nThe \"comrades\" - anti-apartheid activists - confiscated all of them, the T-shirts were set alight and the balls stabbed with pocket knives.\nWe were scolded and told: \"Never again accept anything from the enemy.\" We may have been sad, but we understood why.\nThe morning of the vote was eerily quiet. It was sunny - yet filled with fear and trepidation. \nThe polling station was opposite our house - at a teacher's college. Several blue and white \"peace\" flags were flying high. Political party agents dressed in their different colours were knocking door-to-door, urging people to vote.\nThe snaking queues stretched for miles, with young and old lining up raising their fists in the air, chanting \"sikhululekile\", which means \"we are free\" in Zulu.\nAnd I did feel differently - lighter somehow with the realisation that I would not need to look over my shoulder and hide whenever white policemen on horseback passed by. \nTo this day I may still have a fear of German shepherds, used by the apartheid police as sniffer dogs and sometimes set on us children for no reason during their patrols.\nBut there are many positive reminders of the liberation struggle in Soweto township's Orlando West neighbourhood - so much so that a tourism industry has developed there. \nSakhumzi Maqubela owns a popular restaurant on its famous Vilakazi Street, where both Nelson Mandela, who became president when the African National Congress (ANC) swept to victory in 1994, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu once lived.\n\"Tourism has benefited Vilakazi Street a lot. I saw tourists walking up and down in awe of what South Africa has become, I then decided to start selling food,\" he said.\nMr Maqubela likened his own efforts over the last three decades to those of the country's leaders.\n\"The last 30 years have been trial and error for our government, we can give them credit that they've been learning.\n\"I have created 500 jobs here and I sleep better knowing that my efforts have made a difference.\" \nThe early years of democracy were promising: after Mr Mandela's first term, Thabo Mbeki won the next elections; civil society flourished - as did a vocal and free press.\nBut many feel the honeymoon is definitely over for the ANC, which is still in power and is mired in allegations of corruption and infighting. The country faces high levels of unemployment, violent crime and many still suffer from a lack of basic services like water and electricity. \nThe democratic dividends that Mr Maqubela has enjoyed do not spread far beyond the area around Vilakazi St. \nJust a 10-minute drive away in Kliptown, rows of portable toilets, that are rarely cleaned or emptied, line the streets.\nThere are no schools nearby but plenty of shebeens, as bars in residential areas are known here. Young mothers are struggling to get by. \n\"Thirty years of democracy means nothing to me, there's nothing to celebrate,\" said Tasneema Sylvester, who was sitting outside her shack wearing a sunhat, black jeans and a worn-out red T-shirt. \n\"I won't bother voting this year because I don't see anything that the ANC claims to have done,\" said the 38-year-old mother of three.\n\"I don't have a job, no clean running water, no toilets. I am angry and hopeless.\"\nMs Sylvester's story reflects a much wider truth in South Africa today - the vast gap between the haves and the have-nots.\nAnd people in Kliptown feel that their connection to the liberation struggle is often overlooked, given it was here that the 1955 Freedom Charter was signed - the document drafted by those fighting apartheid that set out the vision of a democratic South Africa.\n\"We've been neglected for too long, it's very sad that none of the 10 clauses of the Freedom Charter have been implemented in this neighbourhood,\" said local tourist guide Ntokozo Dube. \nFor political analyst Tessa Dooms, there are hard questions to consider on the 30th anniversary.\n\"It's very clear that people don't feel like we have fundamentally changed the architecture of our country,\" she said.\n\"There are some glaring things that are still very similar to the past… high levels of inequality persist and have even increased in the democratic era.\"\nThe crisis is illustrated by the hundreds of trained medical doctors who have been staging protests in major cities across the country because they cannot find work.\n\"It's very disheartening because the people of South Africa are in dire need of healthcare yet we have a collapsing system and that's why we have 800 qualified doctors sitting at home,\" said Dr Mumtaaz Emeran-Thomas, who is surviving on freelance work unrelated to her medical skills. \nYoung people especially are demanding change and may abandon any loyalty felt to the ANC for delivering democracy.\nThere are others who feel so disillusioned that they say they will not vote at all.\nYet the vast majority of people, like my mother, who lived through apartheid, cannot forget the gains and still believe in the power of the ballot box. \nAnd as I will be working on 29 May, the seventh general election under democratic rule, she will be taking my six-year-old daughter with her as she lines up at the same Kwa-Thema polling station where she voted in 1994.\nYou can watch Nomsa Maseko's documentary Africa: The battle for the ballot box on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.You can watch Nomsa Maseko's documentary Africa: The battle for the ballot box on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.",

Their first single Attention topped Korean charts right after their debut in July. And  their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.\nThe group has cultivated a big following - its official Instagram account has nearly 12 million followers. They are also becoming a new favourite of investors. The group and its members have been appointed ambassadors of several global fashion brands. In April, they even replaced K-pop sensation Blackpink as the face of the tourism board advertisements at Incheon airport - Korea's biggest. \nIt all started on Monday, when Hybe announced that it was launching an audit on its subsidiary label Ador and its executives including Ms Min. Hybe also called on her to step down.Hybe, which represents massive K-pop groups such as BTS and Seventeen, is South Korea's  largest music firm. Ador was founded in 2021 as an independent label under the company and NewJeans is the only group it manages.According to local media, Hybe accused Ms Min and others of plotting to go independent and take over control of the label, as well as leaking confidential information to attract investors.Ms Min owns an 18% stake in Ador and Hybe owns an 80% stake. The other 2%  is owned by other top executives in Ador.Ms Min denied the allegations and had accused Hybe of launching another girl group Illit that was copying NewJeans' music and appearance. \nAhead of Ms Min's highly-anticipated press conference on Thursday, Hybe told the media that it would report Ms Min to police for \"a breach of trust and other related allegations\". The company said on Friday that the complaint had been filed.The company also said it would continue to provide attentive mental and emotional support to NewJeans.At the press conference, Ms Min again disputed Hybe's side of the story and repeated her previous accusations.She also talked about creative differences with Hybe, and denied allegations that she had said BTS had copied NewJeans. \nSeemingly every twist and turn has made headlines on South Korean news papers and K-pop fans' social media feeds.While both Hybe and Min Hee-jin have stressed their priority is to protect NewJeans, fans are understandably concerned about their idols, who have remained silent on the dispute.\"Hang in there NewJeans! No matter what, Bunnies [fan club name] are and will always be there for you,\" a top comment under the group's IG post on Monday reads.Fans also appear to be divided.\"I love you, NewJeans. Please don't follow Min Hee-jin and make your comeback smoothly,\" one comment liked by more than 900 times reads.\"I will absolutely protect NewJeans and CEO Min!\" another one liked by 700 times says.Korea's general public has also been watching the situation closely. The press conference was broadcast on all three major broadcasters and YouTube. The shirt and cap she wore to address the media sold out on the same day.Many are relating to the situation as they see it as an example of workplace conflict, and one with an angle of gender dynamics. Hybe's shares fell nearly 5% on Friday, while they fell nearly 15% this week.\nIt is not immediately clear what each side will do next. But many local outlets speculate it is likely that the matter will be taken to court.In the press conference, Ms Min said she wanted to sue Hybe for damages.Hybe has requested a shareholders' meeting at Ador to dismiss Ms Min, according to local reports. But many believe it is unlikely to happen given the opposition from Ms Min and her team. If so Hybe will have to turn to the court to get permission to hold an urgent shareholders meeting, This can take up to two months.NewJeans haven't addressed the ongoing dispute. But they are not going to disappear from the public eye. The group has already  revealed that they will release their new double single How Sweet in May. They started releasing teaser images for it on Friday.Additional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul",

        "content": "Deadly storms that left Dubai under water and killed more than 20 people in Oman were likely made worse by climate change, scientists say.\nHeat pumped into the atmosphere by humans made the record rainfall 10-40% heavier, they say.\nBut the natural weather pattern El Niño also drove the intense storms.\nScientists warn the link to climate change is not fully certain because the rarity of rainfall in the region gives them little data to work with.\nThe study was carried out by scientists with the World Weather Attribution group. The experts also said the way that cities have been built made the impacts of the storm worse.\nIn Dubai some areas recorded more than 250mm of rain in less than 24 hours, exceeding all records in daily rainfall in the 75 years since records began.\nThe country averages 140-200 mm of rainfall per year, while Dubai typically receives only 97mm. The monthly average for April is only about 8mm.\nAt least 20 people died in Oman and four in the United Arab Emirates when the storm hit on 15 April. Dubai International Airport, the second busiest in the world, was forced to cancel hundreds of flights. At least 20 people died in Oman and four in the United Arab Emirates when the storm hit on 15 April. Dubai International Airport, the second busiest in the world, was forced to cancel hundreds of flights. \nIt happened after months of hotter-than-average sea surface temperatures partly caused by El Niño - which is when warm waters rise to the surface of parts of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe higher ocean temperatures added more moisture to the atmosphere, making heavy rainfall more likely.\nThe scientists also concluded that cloud seeding - the manipulation of clouds to create more rain - did not have \"significant influence\" on the flooding. \nScientists internationally agree that climate change from burning coal, oil and gas is driving up global temperatures and causing more extreme weather including storms.\nBut it can be harder to say specific events, like a single storm, are caused by climate change because of variability in weather patterns. \nTo find out the answer, scientists look at years of information about weather in a place to identify trends. They also use computer models to compare a world without global warming to the world we live in now with 1.2C of warming since pre-industrial times. \nWithout lots of data, like rainfall information, it can be harder to see patterns and come to strong conclusions.\nBut the basic physics of global warming remain the same and indicate that a hotter atmosphere will create more powerful storms and rainfall, explains Professor Friederike Otto from Imperial College London.\n\"We are quite confident about the link to climate change. Studies by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) show future increases in rainfall intensity in the region,\" she explained. \nProf Otto also said that this study was among the hardest done by the World Weather Attribution group because of gaps in data.\nThe way that cities have been built in the Gulf also made the impacts of the storm on humans more powerful, says Roop Singh from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\nCities built without adequate storm management combined with very dry soils in the region that struggle to absorb excess water means that 85% of people in UAE live in flood-prone areas.",

Three years ago, he was sentenced to 15 months in jail for failing to testify at an inquiry into the allegations, though he only served three months on medical grounds.It has led to divisions and infighting within the ANC. \nJacob Zuma and MK lead 3-0 in court battlesWhat's at stake in South Africa's election?Murders, hitmen and South Africa's election",

        "content": "Colorado-based New Belgium Brewing can trace its roots to 1988 and a cycle trip through Belgium. \nThe experience inspired co-founders Kim Jordan and Jeff Lebesch to bring Belgian brewing techniques back to their home town.\nThree years later and the duo were selling Fat Tire, one of their first beers at a local festival, and they now have over a dozen beers in production.\nBut while they have spent 30 years creating flavours unique to the US market, they have at least one thing in common with all brewers - the use of steam.\nSteam is used to sanitise their brewing equipment, as well as being a key part of the brewing process.\nLarge cone-shaped kettles are used to boil wort - liquid extracted from the initial brewing stage of mashing barley - generating steam.\nThis boiling process helps to remove flavours the brewer does not want in the beer, before the wort is transferred to vessels to ferment with yeast, resulting in beer.\nSome of the steam generated by the kettles is captured by a heat exchanger, which allows the brewer to use this waste heat in the next batch of brewing.\nThe driving force behind the industrial revolution, steam remains crucial to production processes across multiple industries.\nAs well as its frequent use in the food and beverage industry, steam is also used for sterilisation by pharmaceutical companies, and for heating a wide range of buildings such as hospitals.\nBut steam is still primarily generated using boilers run on fossil fuels, giving it a big carbon footprint.\nFossil fuels made up 73% of industrial energy use in the US in 2018, with 40% of these fossil fuels used to heat boilers producing steam.Fossil fuels made up 73% of industrial energy use in the US in 2018, with 40% of these fossil fuels used to heat boilers producing steam.\nTo cut that, one option would be to switch to electric. Assuming the electricity is generated from sustainable sources, then the carbon footprint is slashed.\nBut using electricity does have downsides.\n\"The biggest challenge is cost, which is likely to limit the pace of customer adoption,\" says Maurizio Preziosa, from UK-based engineering firm Spirax Group.\nWhile cost might be an issue, the switch is relatively straightforward. \nMr Preziosa says that his firm's technology can usually slot into the existing system.\n\"Customers can continue to use the rest of their existing steam infrastructure,\" Mr Preziosa explains.\nThis has the additional benefit of reducing downtime, a potential obstacle to adoption for companies reliant on tightly calibrated production processes. \nUS-based AtmosZero has a different approach to creating steam. Their boiler is a heat pump, which extracts heat from the air and turns it into high temperature steam. \nIt works by circulating liquid refrigerants with low boiling points through a closed loop, capturing warmth from the air.\nThe slightly warmed refrigerant is compressed, raising it to a temperature high enough to boil water. \nA heat exchanger then transfers that heat from the refrigerant, to water to make steam. \nThe big advantage of this approach is that it cuts operating costs.\nThe company's chief executive, Addison Stark estimates that their heat pump technology could save companies hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to the options currently available.\n\"Being a heat pump-based system, we are significantly more efficient than current boilers - we create about two units of heat output for one unit of energy input, dramatically reducing the operating costs,\" Mr Stark explains.\nMore technology of business\nAtmosZero is still in the early stages, with more development work needed. The goal is to build a manufacturing plant and start delivering boiler systems in early 2026.\nMr Stark is confident the system will work at the scale needed by industry. \"We are mass-manufactured and simple to deploy.\"\nMakers of green steam equipment see demand rising in the coming years. \n\"The expectations of end consumers are shifting,\" Maurizio Preziosa from Spirax Group explains.\n\"They want to buy from companies who operate sustainably by reducing their impact on people and planet, and this, along with regulatory pressure, is driving demand from our customers who serve those consumers,\" he says.\nBack in Colorado, preparations are underway for at New Belgium Brewing where AtmosZero will be swapping out one of the brewery's combustion boilers for their heat pump system.\nThis is the next step on a journey of sustainability the company has been on since those early days selling their beer at local festivals. \nAs well as installing solar panels and creating electricity from wastewater, Fat Tire, one of their first beers, became the first certified carbon neutral beer in America in August 2020.\nThis is part of a wider company ambition to become completely carbon neutral by 2030.\nChanging the way they use steam may just be the key step towards this goal.",

        "content": "I have been really busy recently, writing articles about famous people.\nI've done interviews with the likes of Zoe Ball, Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Tarrant.\nThere has been a common theme to these stories, and it is all about how each celebrity made vast sums of money from an online investment opportunity in crypto currencies.\nAnd if this all sounds a bit unbelievable, that's because it is - I hadn't done a single one of these interviews, nor written any of the articles. And none of the famous people involved, or me, would dream of endorsing crypto investments of any kind.\nInstead, the fake stories were all AI-generated scams that appeared on Facebook news feeds in a BBC template, and with my byline.\nThe fraudsters behind them hope that people will click through to the full article, and from there be tempted to invest in a fake investment scheme being promoted on the page.\nI was curious as to how these scam posts were getting onto Facebook in the first place, so I contacted Tony Gee, a senior consultant at cybersecurity firm Penn Test Partners.\nAfter examining the URL, or web address, of one scam page he said it was most likely a paid-for Facebook advert.\nMr Gee said he could tell that because the URL had a unique value that Facebook adds to allow it to track outbound clicks.\nI put this finding to Facebook's owner Meta, who said: \"We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms, and have removed the ads brought to our attention.\"\nBut how are the scammers able to get the fake ads onto Facebook news feeds in the first place? How can they get past Facebook's automated detection systems?\nProf Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, says the criminals appear to be using tools that very quickly redirect users to another web page.\nSo when the advert is first placed with Facebook, the link goes through to a harmless page, one that doesn't try to con you out of your cash. But then once this has been approved by Facebook, the fraudsters then put on a redirect that instantly takes people somewhere else - to a web page that very much wants to maliciously dent your bank account.\n\"If you control a website then it is relatively easy to include a redirect command, such that before someone's browser has had a chance to show them the original webpage, their browser is sent to an alternative one,\" says Prof Woodward.\nHe adds that the fraudsters can quickly and easily keep changing the destination of the redirect. \"As soon as you are able to obfuscate the true nature of a URL, that is manna for scammers,\" he says.\nThis is a type of online fraud called \"cloaking\", whereby malicious adverts are able to get past a social media firm's review stage because the fraudsters have hidden their intentions.\nMeta says it is using what it has learnt about this technique to improve its automated detection systems.\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nMargaret (not her real name) is a retiree who lives in Buckinghamshire. She was recently conned out of £250 when she fell victim to fake advert on Instagram, which is also owned by Meta.\nShe had been tempted to click on a link to a fictitious ITV article in which presenter Robert Peston (or rather, a scammer pretending it was him), chats about an investment opportunity he had come across. Margaret who trusts Mr Peston and the ITV brand decided to invest.\nIn addition to paying the £250, Margaret sent off pictures of her passport, and both sides of her credit card. She immediately started getting phone calls.\n\"It was someone with an American accent welcoming me and saying my money was already making money,\" she tells me.\nThe phone calls kept coming, as did a torrent of emails. Margaret became suspicious, particularly when they started asking her about her income and savings, and when she intended to invest more money.\n\"I contacted my bank and was refunded but it didn't stop the scammers.\"\nMargaret still receives daily calls, and even started getting them from someone purporting to be from the US National Security Agency promising to help her investigate the scam.\n\"My own mental health is being impacted and I believe I am at risk, in particular identity theft and indeed potential monetary theft,\" she says. \"They are so mega persistent, and are dangerous pests.\"\nIt is an issue that UK consumer watchdog Which? has been looking into.\n\"Malicious advertisers may mask web links or impersonate trusted brands such as the BBC to evade online platforms' reporting systems, and people often don't know they're looking at a scam or a deepfake until it's too late,\" says Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy.\n\"It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent content online.

        "content": "The first grand opera to be produced in Saudi Arabia has had its opening performance in Riyadh - part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's massively ambitious plans to shift the kingdom into a new era, economically and socially.  \nZarqa Al Yamama is the story of a blue-eyed tribal matriarch with the gift of prophecy in pre-Islamic Arabia. \nHer predictions of imminent danger are ignored by her tribe - a story with a universal resonance according to Ivan Vukcevic, head of Arabian Opera. The company was set up in Switzerland to help develop the performance and teaching of classical music in the Middle East.  \n\"At its core lies the central female heroine with an extraordinary gift of foresight, advocating for reason and love in the face of adversity, even at the expense of her own life,\" he says. describing it as an epic tragedy familiar to many in the Arabic-speaking world.\nWhen the idea of a lavish new opera in Arabic was first presented two years ago, Mr Vukcevic and his company were initially taken aback and puzzled.\nThey wondered how the Arabic language, which is written from right to left, could be integrated into Western classical music notation which goes from left to right. But the standardised romanisation of Arabic helped resolve the issue.  \nThe Arabic libretto has been written by Saudi poet Saleh Zamanan, while the music is by Australian composer Lee Bradshaw.\n\"The brief, as I understood it, was this was to be a Western opera with an influence of Arabic and particularly Saudi music,\" Mr Bradshaw explains. \nHe said he used the rhythmic quality of Mr Zamanan's poetry as the basis for the music.\n\"I actually began the whole process by doing a rhythmic dictation of every line of poetry that we used in the opera. And that became the basis for the setting of all the vocal lines. And from there I sort of worked top down to orchestrate,\" he said.\nBritish opera singer Dame Sarah Connolly is playing the title role of Zarqa Al Yamama and says she had sleepless nights worrying about singing in Arabic. She spent months working with a Saudi language tutor.\n\"I felt listening to Lee's music that he's really beautifully made it recognisable using lots of Arabic sounds that they'll be used to hearing in popular music, various… musical tropes, recognisable modalities, and so on, and all instruments that they'll have heard before, like the Ney flute and the old guitar,\" she said.\nPaolo Petrocelli, who is currently head of Dubai Opera, has played a key role in developing the art form in the Middle East and says that the creation of Zarqa Al Yamama is part of a wider trend in the region.\nHe says the wider Gulf region has \"witnessed a remarkable evolution in opera theatre\" that reflects a growing appreciation for performing arts. Investments in state-of-the-art venues and cultural initiatives have seen the region become a \"dynamic hub for opera\" that is able to attract top talent and stage immersive productions, he says.\n\"This development underscores the region's commitment to fostering artistic expression and enriching its cultural landscape.\"\nThere are opera houses in Cairo, Damascus, Muscat and Dubai and Saudi Arabia is also building a state of the art opera house as part of the redevelopment of the historic Diriyah district in Riyadh. \nThe Saudi investment in developing its cultural heft in the region and beyond matches similar efforts in sport and other sectors. And there's no doubt that there has been a genuine transformation - by no means welcomed by all Saudis - in many aspects of day-to-day life in the country.\nIn offices, universities and entertainment venues, Saudi men and women now mix freely, with no morality police to impose once strictly observed gender segregation. \nRiyadh now hosts months of lavish entertainment each year, attracting the biggest stars in the Arab world and beyond, in contrast to a decade or two ago when any public performance was vanishingly rare. Middle Beast, a huge rave event, takes place regularly on the outskirts of the Saudi capital - it's all now part of the fabric of Saudi society.\nConservative elements in the country have bemoaned the changes, while the less well off are to some extent excluded by ticket prices. Tradition remains powerful in the kingdom too, meaning that many young Saudis, particularly women, have yet to participate in this new Saudi Arabia.\nBut the new Saudi Arabia has also been accompanied by widespread suppression of dissent, with long prison sentences meted out to a number of Saudis who have expressed criticism on social media. \nAnd the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.And the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.\nThere's been plenty of controversy over the decision by world famous sporting celebrities, like Portuguese football star Ronaldo, to play in Saudi Arabia. Human rights groups have denounced it as \"sportswashing\" - using major sporting events or stars to divert attention from a country's conduct. Similar accusations have been made over stars in entertainment and culture. \n\"If Saudi Arabia is truly committed to 'social reforms', then the starting point should be investing in education, schools, healthcare, and basic human rights for people below the poverty line, among other necessities,\" says Maryam al-Dossari, a Saudi activist.\n\"While opera, cinema, and musical festivals are welcomed, they should not be the primary focus and merely designed to attract Western attention.\"\nSarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the human rights group Dawn - which was founded by Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed - is even more scathing.\n\"The Saudi government's all-out promotion of the country as a liberal, modern country with events like this opera show stand in such stark contrast to its cruel and repressive rule in the country,\" she said.\n\"It wants to be seen as a progressive government by dressing up as a progressive government without actually behaving like a progressive government.\"\nFor his part, composer Mr Bradshaw believes that the benefits music brings can transcend politics.  \n\"We came here probably 18 months ago to do some auditions and we saw hundreds of young Saudis auditioning for extra roles, for dancers, for acrobats, all manner of things, musicians,\" he said. \n\"And it was really amazing to speak to some of them who communicated very clearly to us that some of them never thought that they'd have an opportunity to do anything like this. And that really just galvanised in my mind the fact that we absolutely have to come here and do this. \n\"I think it's important that culture goes everywhere in the world because it is the strongest unifying force that we've got.\"",

        "content": "For nearly three hours on Thursday, the Supreme Court weighed whether former presidents are immune from prosecution and what exactly it means if they are. \nIts answer will determine whether former President Donald Trump can be tried on charges of trying to subvert the 2020 election.\nWhatever the decision, each justice indicated that it would shape US democracy for years to come.\n\"We're writing a rule for the ages,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch said. \nThe case, heard in a special session one day after the court's last scheduled argument of this term, hinges on Mr Trump's claim that he is entitled to absolute immunity from criminal charges for actions committed while in office. \nAccording to Mr Trump, this immunity shields him from criminal charges brought by US Special Counsel Jack Smith that he allegedly attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. \nThat trial will remain on hold until the court issues its decision, expected in June. \nThe justices' pointed questions, levelled at both sides, indicated division within the bench, and suggested a split decision may be likely. That division could also lead to a more complicated decision that would significantly delay any restart of the trial.\nTheir questions, along with tense exchanges and high-stakes hypothetical scenarios, also showed that both the conservative majority and liberal minority are making the decision with an eye to history. Would total immunity mean a future president was free to use the US military to kill his or her rivals? Or, without it, would presidents leaving office be subject to the whims of individual prosecutors and thrown in jail as part of political vendettas? \nThey also brought up the pardoning of another former president, Richard Nixon, for his involvement in the Watergate coverup, and Operation Mongoose from the 1960s - where then-President John F. Kennedy had the Central Intelligence Agency carry out covert operations against Fidel Castro.\nWhile the conservative side seemed open to the idea that all former US presidents should have some degree of immunity, all the justices sounded sceptical of arguments made by Mr Trump's lawyer, Dean John Sauer, that a former president has near-total protection from prosecution.\nAnswering questions first, Mr Sauer was grilled by the nine justices on the breadth of that protection. \n\"How about if the president orders the military to stage a coup?\" asked Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court's three liberal justices. \nMr Sauer appeared hesitant to respond before saying it would \"depend on the circumstances\". \nJustice Kagan, sounding incredulous, replied: \"That sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?\" \nLater, following this same thread, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, also a liberal justice, expressed concern that if past presidents were shielded entirely from criminal prosecution, they would be untethered from the law.\n\"I'm trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the Oval Office into the seat of criminality,\" she said. \nThe conservative justices, too, pressed Mr Sauer on the distinction between \"official acts\" - those done as part of presidential duties - and private acts. \n\"My question is whether the very robust form of immunity you're advocating is necessary,\" asked Samuel Alito, one of the court's most conservative justices.\nBut Michael Dreeben, representing the US government, faced the same sharp interrogation as the justices walked through the consequences of leaving US presidents without some level of criminal protection. \nWhat if a president directed a violent attack on foreign soil, Justice Clarence Thomas asked, could that president later be prosecuted? \nMr Dreeben responded that there are \"layers of protection\" already in place to protect presidents from criminal liability for doing their job, including actions taken overseas. \nJustice Alito in particular sounded concerned about another possible consequence: that presidents may be subject to partisan attacks, perhaps by their successors, once they leave office. \n\"This could destroy the presidency as we know it,\" said Justice Alito, who dominated the second half of the hearing.\nBut the conservative justices did not present a united front. \nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, appointed by Mr Trump, seemed dubious of the notion that presidents deserve blanket immunity.\nWhen Mr Dreeben said there was \"no perfect system\" for handling a president's culpability, but that the current system would not be improved by Mr Trump's \"radical proposal\" Justice Barrett replied: \"I agree.\"  \nA fractured ruling - one that does not side entirely with either Mr Trump's lawyer or the special counsel - may instead send the question or a part of it to lower courts to decide. This would surely add further delay and be subject to appeal, meaning this legal battle will continue for months, if not years, to come. .  ",

And we'd encourage them to do that,\" he said.\nSome say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed.Some say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed.\nMark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has previously suggested that he favours requiring app-stores to check the ages of users.\nResponding to the Ofcom report, Clare Fernyhough, of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, told the BBC that society had sleep-walked into \"just assuming that we all need a smartphone - and now we're beginning to see the huge impact that that's having\"\nBut Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre, said it was wrong to protect children by restricting their access to technology.\n\"This is the first generation with access to a powerful personal computer, it could be so amazing for them, and that's what children want too,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But the companies are risky by design, and what we need is child rights by design\", she said.\nOfcom said new age limits for smartphones would be a matter for government. \nIn May it will be consulting on the steps it expects tech firms to take to ensure children have safer experiences online, and later on new uses of AI to combat harmful content online.\nIn a statement, the Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation Michelle Donelan said protecting children online was the government's number one priority.\n\"Children as young as five should not be accessing social media and these stark findings show why our Online Safety Act is essential,\" she said.\nDoes your young child have a smartphone?

        "content": "Tesla has announced its profits fell sharply in the first three months of the year to $1.13bn (£910m), compared with $2.51bn in 2023.It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced  thousands of job cuts.Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward.Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals.\nThe company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024.  Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn. But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading. It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles. However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the \"wrong framework.\"\"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,\" he said.Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face \"technological, regulatory and operational challenges.\"Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV.However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales. Tesla cuts prices in major markets as sales fallIt also said its situation was not unique. \"Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,\" it said. \nDespite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce. Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June. The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located.However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move. \"Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!\" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York. Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators.\nThe car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on.On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge.On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge.The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out.Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries.In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday.In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday.",

        "content": "TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.\nThe video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of users' data and its links to the government in Beijing.\nLawmakers from both major US political parties have called for a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company.\nThey fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government.\nThe House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok.The House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok.\nThe legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden. The legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden. \nPrevious attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed.\nFormer US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020.\nBut Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook.\nAlthough Mr Biden has signed the bill into law, it does not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok.\nThe legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect.\nThat means that the sale deadline would most likely come some time in 2025, after the winner of the 2024 presidential election takes office. If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. \nTikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. \nThe most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices.\nApp stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. \nIt would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs.\nThe bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. \nIt gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.\nTikTok has called the legislation an \"unconstitutional ban\" and affront to the US right to free speech.\n\"We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. \"Rest assured,\" he told users in a video, \"we aren't going anywhere\".\"We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. \"Rest assured,\" he told users in a video, \"we aren't going anywhere\".\nHe previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk.\nByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move.\nMany US creators and users have criticised the potential ban.\nTiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work.\nIn March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill.\nBut the deluge of \"confused\" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. But the deluge of \"confused\" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. \nSeveral politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.\nIt is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. \nTikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. \nIt is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.\nThe UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. \nThe BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.\nAt the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. \nUsers are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.\nThe Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.\nThis curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.\nCritics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system.\nThis can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing.\nBut popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users.",

Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently.\nThese recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight.Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently.More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site.It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV.Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages.But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen.\"The internet is not exactly getting more stable,\" he told the BBC.To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself.Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong.\"Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,\" Mr Smith said. \"I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech companies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking things.\"\nThe other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down.The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over.

The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021.The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021.'It had just vanished' - the shock when tech fails\nSudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends.Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says.But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them.\"Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,\" he says.IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes.IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes.More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it.Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called \"thundering herds\" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site.Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called \"thundering herds\" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site.\nUnderpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies \"on a fabric of really old technology\", says Mr Kirkman.He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021.He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021.Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet.And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses.And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses\nMr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms.It highlights what he says some might consider \"technical debt\" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet.These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them.\"What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,\" says Mr Smith.\"I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,\" he adds.",

        "content": "\"This is not a blow to the movement,\" MeToo founder Tarana Burke stated defiantly as she responded to the overturning of Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction in New York.\n\"It is a clarion call and we are prepared to answer that call,\" she proclaimed.\nShe spoke after a New York Court of Appeals ruled that Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most successful and influential producers, did not receive a fair trial in 2020 because prosecutors called witnesses whose accusations were not part of the charges against him.\nThe consequence: the judges ordered Weinstein face a new trial.\nArthur Aidala, the movie mogul's lawyer, hailed the decision as a \"victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York\".\nHe added: \"There are still people who are very unpopular in our society, but we still have to apply the law fairly to them at that trial. The law was not applied fairly to Harvey Weinstein.\"\nWeinstein's New York trial was pivotal for the MeToo movement, the campaign against sexual abuse which went viral online after several women came forward alleging that he had sexually abused them.\nWeinstein has always maintained his innocence and his defence team said at the time of the New York trial that sex between the movie executive and accusers was consensual.\nA representative for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said on Thursday that he would retry the case. \nMs Burke, an activist who works with survivors of sexual violence, began using the phrase \"Me Too\" in 2006 to raise awareness of women who had been abused. \nEleven years later, it found global recognition after actress Alyssa Milano, one of those who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, used the phrase in a viral tweet.\n\"We are devastated for the survivors who are connected to this case and the survivors who had found some solace and catharsis in the original verdict around Harvey Weinstein,\" Ms Burke said.\n\"Many people, many survivors and those who love and support survivors probably thought that original verdict meant that there was going to be a change, that it marked a change and marked a difference in how this justice system was going to move and operate,\" she explained.\nBut she added that \"this moment, and this decision, actually means that we have a movement\", emphasising that much progress has still been made.\n\"Ten years ago, we could not get a man like Harvey Weinstein into a courtroom,\" she said.\nRowena Chiu said she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein in a hotel room in Venice in 1998 when she was his personal assistant. She initially signed a non-disclosure agreement but later went public with her story. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Friday, Ms Chiu said: \"I'm encouraged by what people have said, that this should be a clarion call.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Friday, Ms Chiu said: \"I'm encouraged by what people have said, that this should be a clarion call.\n\"I myself have said the work is only just beginning.\"\nBut she added that the overturning of the New York verdict does \"very much feel like a leap back\".\nMs Chiu said it was already the case that it was \"incredibly difficult\" to be successful when bringing a sexual assault case. \"But these verdicts were glimmers of hope in centuries of darkness for women's rights.\n\"Today is not going to be a day that will encourage [survivors] to change that situation.\"\nMs Chiu hopes the overturning of the New York rape conviction will result in a call for legal reform and a change to how secondary witnesses are allowed to be used in New York in future.\nOthers, however, are of the view that the court ruling should be respected to ensure that everyone is treated fairly.\nFor Ms Burke, however, the MeToo movement is about more than Harvey Weinstein.\nSpeaking at a red carpet event on Thursday, the MeToo founder told the Associated Press news agency: \"One singular man getting away with it\" doesn't mean that a world free of sexual violence is something that can't be realised.\n\"So I'm not worried about one singular man. I'm worried about what our judicial system's going to do, what our culture's going to do - what are we going to do?\"\nMs Burke has previously spoken about how celebrity cases of sexual abuse should not be seen as the only marker of the MeToo movement's success. \nSeeing which \"celebrity goes to jail or not is not sustainable as a movement\", she told the BBC in 2020 following Weinstein's (now-overturned) conviction.Seeing which \"celebrity goes to jail or not is not sustainable as a movement\", she told the BBC in 2020 following Weinstein's (now-overturned) conviction.\nRather, she said, victory for the movement should be measured by focusing on the wellbeing of survivors.\nWeinstein, 72, remains in prison. He was separately convicted of rape in Los Angeles in 2022.\nBefore the allegations against him emerged, the producer and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.\nThey co-founded Miramax Films, a distribution company named after their mother Miriam and father Max, in 1979. It was sold to Disney in 1993.\nTheir hits included 1998's Shakespeare in Love, for which Weinstein shared a best-picture Oscar. Over the years, Weinstein's films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.",

It uses high energy rays to attack the cancer.\nNot all treatments can cure, however. \nStaging is a way doctors describe how big the cancer is and how far it has spread, which can help with deciding the best treatment. \nThere are different systems or ways used by doctors. \nFor example, staging can use numbers, where one refers to a small cancer that has not spread, compared to four, which means it is advanced and spreading around the body. \nThe chances of someone surviving cancer have significantly improved over the last 50 years, but the rate of improvement has slowed.\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, half of people diagnosed with cancer survive their disease for 10 years or more.According to Cancer Research UK, half of people diagnosed with cancer survive their disease for 10 years or more.\nCancer survival is usually higher in people diagnosed when they are under 40.\nHowever, survival with breast, bowel and prostate cancers are highest in middle age.However, survival with breast, bowel and prostate cancers are highest in middle age.\nIf you notice something that isn't normal for you, see a doctor. \nThat might include:\nThe symptoms you are experiencing may not be cancer, but it is important to get checked. \nFinding cancer early can often make it easier to treat.\nNot all cancers are preventable - we can't choose the genes we inherit, or change the age we are.\nBut there are some steps we can all take to reduce the risk of some cancers.But there are some steps we can all take to reduce the risk of some cancers.",

The army director of communications said he would get back to the BBC if and when they make a statement. \nIn a statement on Thursday, Burkina Faso's media regulator warned all media outlets against covering the report, threatening sanctions, state-owned media reported.\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"The suspension reduces the BBC's ability to reach audiences with independent and accurate news.

        "content": "Greece has rejected pressure from European allies to help Ukraine boost its air defences, arguing that Athens needs the systems for itself.\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed for at least seven more Patriots or similar defence batteries to protect its cities and power plants from Russian attack.\nBut Greece has said it cannot spare any of its Patriot or S-300 systems.\nReports say Spain will supply some Patriot missiles but not a full system.\nSpain and Greece have come under pressure to help Ukraine from both Nato and European Union allies, in response to attacks on vulnerable cities including Chernihiv and power facilities in Kharkiv and close to Kyiv.\nUkraine only has a handful of Patriots to complement other Western missile defence systems and existing stocks of Soviet-era surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), such as the S-300.\nPatriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. \nPresident Zelensky said on Friday that Russian jets had targeted Ukraine with more than 9,000 \"guided aerial bombs\" so far this year and Kyiv needed to be able to shoot their planes down. \n\"We urgently need better systems. And missiles for them to save lives right now,\" he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, an alliance of Nato members and partner countries.\nGermany has already promised an extra Patriot, and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $6bn weapons programme on Friday, to include missile intercepts for Patriot and Nasam (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) air defence systems.\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg has suggested that Ukraine's allies have not provided support they promised. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell said this week: \"The Patriots are in the capitals. And it's up to them to take the decisions.\"\nGreece in particular has stocks of Patriots and S-300s. But Prime Minister Kyrios Mitsotakis has ruled out handing any to Kyiv. \"We explained why we cannot do it,\" he told Skai TV. \nHis said his country's air defences were \"critical systems for the protection of Greek air space\".\nAthens has provided Kyiv with weapons and ammunition but is wary of losing any of its deterrent capability because of potential flare-ups with neighbour Turkey, even though relations at the moment are relatively stable.\nSpain's military has three Patriot batteries, but argues that it needs them and can only provide a \"very limited number\" of Patriot missiles because its reserve is low, sources have told El País newspaper. \nEach Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m.\nThe continuing dilemma for Ukraine's military commanders is where to place the missile systems, close to the country's vulnerable cities or near the front line where Russia's advances are most intense.\nRecent Russian successes have been characterised by greater use of airpower. Su-34 fighter bombers have been dropping precision-guided munitions on Ukrainian forces. \nWe do not know where Ukraine place their SAM systems, but mitigating this growing Russian aerial threat might mean missile defence concentrates on the eastern front line.\nThat risks taking away a degree of missile defence for key cities and important areas of infrastructure - the sort of areas that have been regularly pounded by Russian cruise missiles and attack drones. \nThat is why Ukraine has been pleading for greater missile defences to plug the gaps in vulnerable areas. \nRussia's latest strikes have targeted Ukraine's railway system in three regions. \nRail operator Ukrzaliznytsia said three of its mechanics were killed in a Russian missile attack while they were working in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday. Russia said it hit a train carrying Western weapons and military hardware near Udachne, about 45km (28 miles) from the front line.\nThirteen people were also wounded in a strike on a train station in Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region, and officials said a passenger train was 15m (50ft) from the station when it came under attack. In a separate Russian attack, rail infrastructure was damaged in the central Cherkasy region.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has had to pull back US M1 Abrams battle tanks from the front line, according to a report by the Associated Press. \nThirty-one Abrams tanks were originally provided to help Ukrainian forces operate on the battlefield, but Russia's increased use of drones has made the tanks harder to protect and five have been lost, AP reported.",

        "content": "A leading California university has cancelled its graduation ceremony as protests over Gaza continue to spread on college campuses across the US.\nThe University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles cited \"new safety measures\" in disbanding the event.\nHundreds of people have been arrested on dozens of campuses where protests and encampments have sprung up in support of Palestinians in Gaza.\nUniversities have brought in police to force students to leave.\nBut some are also negotiating. At Columbia University in New York City, where the protests began last week, a Thursday night deadline for an end to the encampment was dropped.\nTalks were showing progress and would continue, the university said.  \nAt Atlanta's Emory University, 28 demonstrators were arrested on Thursday after refusing to leave.\nEmory's police force said protesters had \"pushed past\" officers protecting the area set up for commencement on Thursday morning.\nThe force acknowledged that chemical irritants had been released as part of crowd control measures, though they said it was in response to objects being thrown at officers.\nAtlanta Police also confirmed using chemical irritants but denied reports they had fired rubber bullets at protesters.\nOne protester shown on video being detained by police identified herself as Noelle McAfee, chair of Emory's philosophy department. \nMs McAfee said she was observing what she described as a peaceful protest when police began to move in and the protesters started to march.\n\"It went from a peaceful protest to mayhem in the matter of a minute,\" she said. She said she had frozen and been quickly detained. \nThe latest wave of campus protests began after officials at Columbia University called in police to clear a new protest encampment and more than 100 people were arrested. \nActivists have been calling for universities to \"divest from genocide\" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza.\nIsrael is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as \"baseless\". \nChisato Mimura, a law student and protest leader at Yale University in Connecticut, told the BBC that activists were upset at President Joe Biden as well as their school officials for \"quite literally funding and equipping the weapons used in genocide\". \n\"What they're doing is completely putting their full weight behind it,\" she said. \"We are well aware of the prominent role they are playing.\"\nSome of the protests on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism. A number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. \nEarlier on Thursday, Minnesota Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar visited the campus. Her daughter, Isra Hirsi, was one of the protesters cleared from the university by police last week.\n\"This is a movement that started with only 70 students,\" Ms Omar told the BBC. \"And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their First Amendment [rights], this has now spread nationally and internationally.\"\nIn other recent developments:\nThe war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 34,180 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nAre you a student in the US?

        "content": "Yvonne Valentine thought her son had moved out when she popped over to the home of his long-time partner around Christmas time. The pair shared a drink, but little did she know her son was buried a few feet away in the back garden. How did a primary school teacher become a killer and how was her crime uncovered?\nNicholas Billingham had been in a relationship with Fiona Beal, a well-liked Year 6 teacher at Northampton's Eastfield Academy, since about 2004.\nBut in late 2021 his mum received what she described as a \"really long text\" from his phone, which was \"a bit unusual for Nick\".\nThe message said he had just come out of a football match at Manchester United's ground, he was living in Essex and working with cars. \nIt went on to say he was now in a relationship with someone call Faye and \"I know you must think of me... but I'm really happy\".\nFiona said: \"I left it at that and said, 'well as long as you're happy Nick', which I was more concerned about.\"\nThe message was not from Nick.\nProsecutors told Beal's first crown court trial that she used his phone to send messages to friends and work colleagues, pretending that he was still alive.\nShe had, in fact, stabbed Nick in the neck and buried him in the garden of the home they shared in Moore Street, Northampton, under a mound of bark chippings and building materials.\nBeal had told the school she had tested positive for Covid-19 and she was absent from work between 1 and 12 November 2021.\nOn 13 November, she was caught on CCTV in a B&Q, being helped by a member of staff with two trollies carrying bags of compost and stones and a light-coloured plastic planter.\nWhen she returned to work she said her partner had left her, but there were no concerns about her performance.\nUnaware her son had been killed by Beal, Yvonne went over to the home.\n\"Fiona offered me a Christmas drink. I said, 'oh thank you'. So we sat there with this drink,\" she said.\n\"But then it always gets to me because I think Nick was buried in the garden just a few feet away and I didn't know he was there. It just seemed normal, like I'd been to visit them before.\"\nLooking back, she tries not to think about it too much \"but when I do it just, it's sort of draining - it's horrible to think of how she buried him\".\n\"How you could hate somebody that much to do what she did? I thought she loved him.\"\nIt was not until March 2022 when Yvonne received a call from Northamptonshire Police to inform her Nick was a missing person.\n\"And I said, 'what?' I couldn't believe it, just couldn't believe it,\" she said.\nPolice had become involved after Beal was absent from work.\nShe was detained under the Mental Health Act when officers traced her to a rented lodge in Cumbria.\nA notebook found there said: \"I thought about leaving but the things he said and did fuelled my dark side - I call her Tulip22, she's reckless, fearless and efficient. Ruthless.\"\nIt later added: \"I got him to wear an eye mask. It was harder than I thought it would be. Hiding a body was bad. Moving a body is much more difficult than it looks on TV.\"\nBeal claimed in the notebook she had been spat on and threatened during sex, and subjected to cruel and belittling treatment.\nYvonne said her son \"wasn't an angel. I don't think I know anybody who is an angel\". \n\"He had his moments like we all do I suppose. He wasn't an angel but I don't think he was a devil either,\" she said.\nIn Beal's first crown court trial, she accepted the killing but denied murder, with her defence team stating she had been manipulated by the \"psychologically domineering\" Nick to the point where she was \"broken\".\nBut that original trial collapsed after a legal error, when it emerged a key defence witness was a court custody officer who had conducted welfare checks on Beal.\nShortly into her retrial at the Old Bailey on Friday, Beal changed her plea, admitting murder. She is due to be sentenced next month.Shortly into her retrial at the Old Bailey on Friday, Beal changed her plea, admitting murder. She is due to be sentenced next month.\nSpeaking last year while the first trial was ongoing, Yvonne said: \"I still expect to bump into Nick somewhere, you know, up the high street or in a pub or somewhere and I'm sure his friends probably do as well.\n\"But I think we'll just have to try and move on.

        "content": "The Labour Party has said it expects to renationalise most passenger rail services in England within five years, if it is elected.But what will this mean for passengers, and when could it come into effect?\nShadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said she could not say that Labour would lower fares, but they would simplify them.\"We'll make them more accessible, more transparent and more trustworthy for passengers, \" she said.Ms Haigh also said Labour would deliver a \"best fare guarantee\", so people could be sure they are always paying the lowest fare for their journey.Labour pledges to renationalise most rail services within five yearsHowever, railway specialist Tony Miles - who has covered the industry for over 40 years -  said any savings were likely to be minimal because the private operators' profit margins are already so small, at an average of 12p for each passenger journey.He argued this would mean Labour would only be able to pass on very small savings per journey.\nFrom just after the Second World War until the 1990s the UK rail system was fully nationalised, with the government owning the rail networks and all of the trains.The industry was privatised in the 1990s, with services run by a variety of train operating companies.At the moment the infrastructure is managed by Network Rail, while passenger train services are run by individual operators.However, there are degrees of nationalisation. During the pandemic, the government in effect took control of the railway, with most train companies in England moving onto contracts where they get a fixed fee to run services, and the taxpayer carries the financial risk.The situation is different in Scotland and Wales, where passenger services are already run by the devolved governments. In Northern Ireland, the system is fully nationalised.Under Labour's plans, a new arm's-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), would take over the service contracts currently held by private firms in England as they expire in the future.However, GBR would continue to lease rolling stock from private firms, and there is no plan to nationalise rail freight companies.Whether it will make the trains run better \"comes down to how they’re going to fund things\", says Peter Simmons, deputy editor at International Railway Journal.\"The issue under the old days of nationalisation was that the government of the day wasn’t prepared to fund things in a way that allowed major construction projects to move forward.”\nLuxembourg operates a fully state-run system where all train journeys are free, and train tickets in other European countries with more state control than the UK can be much cheaper.However, those networks also receive lots of government investment, which can mean higher taxes.Mr Miles argues the UK’s franchising system, whereby the government owns the network through National Rail and hands out operator contracts to private companies, was the “envy of Europe” before Covid hit.He said passenger numbers have increased as a result of the franchise system, but added that the contracts written during Covid were done so “in a rush” and are “too generous”.He pointed to Transport for London and the Manchester bus service as examples of where a state run franchising system to private contractors can work.Mr Simmons says trains in the UK are \"not as bad as people think\".\"Sometimes the perception is that everywhere else is better, and that’s very much not true.”However, he said other countries were “powering ahead” with long-term planning for major projects.\nA Labour government could wait until the current franchise contracts run out and take them on itself, as the government did during Covid. There would not necessarily be any upfront costs to do this.However, doing so would also mean taking on the railway operators debts, leases, and liabilities, such as their pension fund pots and the lease contracts for the trains.If Labour wanted to invest in the railway network or buy back the trains, that would cost money.Labour says its plans would save the taxpayer £2.2bn a year, but Louise Haigh said she had no guarantee that all this money would be reinvested in the railways.Andy Bagnall, the chief executive of Rail Partners, which represents private operators on the rail network, says nationalisation will lead to higher costs in the long run.He says that without the commercial focus of private firms, \"costs would creep up over time, revenue growth will be slower and the taxpayer is the one that loses out\".\nIf Labour were to win the general election - expected later this year - then \"it could happen very quickly,\" says Mr Simmons, given the plan is to transfer train networks to public ownership as the current operator contracts begin to run out.Some train operators are already under public control after being taken into the government’s Operator of Last Resort.Many train operators' franchises come up for renewal in the next few years, but most contain some form of break clause, which means the government could take control earlier.For example, Avanti West Coast's contract was renewed in October last year and runs for a maximum of nine years, which would take it to 2032 and beyond the next parliament.However, the contract has a \"core term\" of three years, after which the government can terminate it at three months' notice.\nUK private operators' contract expiry dates*South Western - May 2025Essex Thameside (c2c) - July 2025East Anglia - September 2026West Midlands - September 2026Chiltern - December 2027Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern - April 2028Great Western - June 2028East Midlands - October 2030Cross Country (Arriva) - October 2031West Coast - October 2032*Does not include break or extension clausesUK public operatorsCaledonian SleeperEast Coast (LNER)NI RailwaysNorthernScotRailSouth EasternTransPennine ExpressTransport for WalesSource: Rail Partners",

The CEO of Nats, formerly National Air Traffic Services, Martin Rolfe, insisted the ability to problem solve remotely when called upon was \"a bonus\".There was air traffic chaos last August Bank Holiday Monday when flights ground to a halt in and out of the UK because of an IT systems failure. It took an on-call senior engineer took more than 90 minutes to reach the office after he was unable to fix the issue at home.  \nThe major outage disrupted flight plans for almost 750,000 passengers last summer.Low-cost airline Ryanair levied particularly strong criticism at Nats in the aftermath of the August incident. Its boss Michael O'Leary accused engineers of \"sitting at home in their pyjamas\".However, speaking to the Transport Committee on Tuesday about what Nats had done to make its systems resilient, Mr Rolfe defended his organisation's staffing arrangements.He said it operated a \"very similar model to almost all of the rest of critical national infrastructure\".He added that there were always engineers on site to solve problems, but more expert \"design engineers\" were needed for particularly complex issues.Mr Rolfe said they were generally in the office during the week but could be on-call outside of normal working hours.He insisted the situation last August \"would have been worse\" without remote working technology.\"We would have had to get them physically in immediately. Now we have the ability for them to log on appropriately and securely, remotely,\" he said.\"In many cases, they fix the problem much more quickly than if they had to come into the office outside of normal hours. It's an absolute advancement in how we deal with these things\".\nAnother point made in a recent interim report by an independent panel (commissioned by the Civil Aviation Authority) was the lack of  \"any multi-agency rehearsal of the management of an incident of this nature and scale\".Mr Rolfe told the committee hearing that Nats wanted to lead an industry-wide \"practice run\" for a disruption scenario, but this would not happen until after the peak summer period.The panel's final report and recommendations are expected later this year.",

But proposals for a \"modest\" tourism tax on overnight visitors will not be taken further.Council leader Rick Everitt said the council has \"no powers\" to implement the tax and the government has \"no intention\" of giving the council such powers. Mr Everitt said the tourism report will be resubmitted to cabinet later this year, \"following investigations into the feasibility of its suggestions\".\nJane Bishop, owner of The Walpole Bay Hotel, Museum and Napery Gallery, said: “It’s fair to not have a tourist tax on overnight stays only, especially as most of the tourism happens with day trippers on our beaches so I do applaud the decision. “I’m very pleased about it but we all need to get together to decide and find a way of raising extra funds for our council to help keep our isle clean.”Some local authorities have found ways to charge visitors extra, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

        "description": "Expanding the West Midlands' tram network carries an \"enormous cost\" that may prove difficult to meet.",
        "content": "Expanding the West Midlands' tram network carries an \"enormous cost\" that may prove difficult to meet.\nThat is the finding of a document seen by the BBC that sets out the project's significant challenges.\nAn analysis of the Metro system, which links Birmingham to Wolverhampton, states \"significant investment\" is needed if a rapid network is to be delivered.\nBut the document says the cost of one planned extension is \"prohibitive\".\nThere have already been several extensions and more are in the works.\nOne to Dudley and a second in east Birmingham are expected to cost at least £700m.\nBut these routes have been hampered by delays, economic pressures and rising costs, raising fears parts of the Metro expansion could be scrapped.\nThe challenges of delivery are underlined in a document that has been sent to the BBC in response to a Freedom of Information request.\nThe report is a business plan for a Very Light Rail (VLR) service, effectively a tram system, earmarked for Coventry.\nThe plan was supported by Transport for West Midlands - operator and owner of the Metro - which sets out therein the financial case for VLR in the city, making note of its experience of expanding the Metro network.\nThe body states in the document that such efforts have \"illustrated the enormous cost and lengthy timescale to deliver this mode of transit\".\nIt adds: \"Also, the cost of vehicles and infrastructure including track have incurred high costs to maintain the system.\"\nTransport for West Midlands says VLR could be delivered at \"potentially lower costs and shorter timescales\".\nBut the outlook for the Metro is more complex.\nElsewhere in the document, Transport for West Midlands says one extension to the Metro \"has been looked at extensively and business cases developed and while there is a strong case to deliver this, the cost to deliver this scheme is prohibitive\".\nThe name of the extension has been removed under a Freedom of Information exemption.\nLast year, in the case of the Dudley extension, the Express and Star newspaper reported the cost of linking Wednesbury to Brierley Hill had increased by 45%, from £449m to £650m.Last year, in the case of the Dudley extension, the Express and Star newspaper reported the cost of linking Wednesbury to Brierley Hill had increased by 45%, from £449m to £650m.\nAnd in Birmingham, the budget for the Eastside Metro extension has risen from £227m in 2020 to £245m this year. A temporary station is being installed because construction work on the track has been delayed by high speed rail network HS2.\nThe further extension of that line - to Solihull - had been forecast to cost about £700m, with that figure expected to rise if the plans went ahead.\nThe West Midlands Combined Authority, of which Transport for West Midlands is part, announced plans to deliver further Metro routes, or rapid bus services, last month.\nBut the rising costs raise questions about the use of public money to fund the move.\nOn 2 May, the local electorate will decide who is West Midlands mayor and leader of the authority, with the candidates setting out their plans for the Metro.\nAndy Street, Conservative, is seeking a third term and has pledged to \"forge ahead with new routes\".\nMr Street's campaign said his 2040 transport plan was \"a huge endeavour, requiring significant investment\".\nA campaign spokesperson said the region's average annual investment in transport had increased tenfold to £406m since Mr Street became mayor.\nThe transport pledges in Mr Street's manifesto had been \"fully costed\" and potential funding sources for Metro projects identified, the spokesperson added.\nLabour candidate Richard Parker has pledged to continue funding the Metro's expansion to Brierley Hill and to Solihull.\nMr Parker also claims his plans are \"fully costed and fully funded\", with a spokesperson adding Mr Street has a record of \"over promising and under delivering\".\n\"Project after project has been cancelled or delayed due to mismanagement of plans and no proper grip on costs,\" they said.\nThe costs of the Metro were branded \"extortionate\" by Reform UK's candidate, Elaine Williams.\nShe said there needed to be \"a total rethink on travel to deliver a fully integrated, efficient, safe and more effective transport system\".\n\"The Metro is wasting the people's money,\" she said.\n\"Buses are far cheaper to buy and run than the tram cars and ancillary equipment.\"\nThe independent candidate, Akhmed Yakoob, said the \"budgetary increases and delays\" to Metro extensions \"illustrate the dynamic nature of large-scale infrastructure endeavours\".\nHe described the \"overinflated cost\" of expanding the Metro as \"just another indictment on the Tory-led government which has mismanaged Brexit, the economy; and has presided over soaring inflation\".\nHe said the approach was too \"fragmented\" and argued using \"many different private construction companies was going to add to extra logistical and financial pressures\".\nHe said addressing these challenges required exploring alternative technologies like VLR, improving project management practices and prioritising how funding was used.\nThe campaign for the Green candidate, Siobhan Harper-Nunes, said \"innovation can play a part in getting the best bang for our buck\".\n\"This is why it was so disappointing that the Very Light Rail was not fully funded,\" her spokesperson said.\nBut the spokesperson added \"even the best value-for-money transport improvements will require significant investment for the scale of change we need\".\nMs Harper-Nunes called for \"London levels of investment\" in the region's transport.\nLiberal Democrat candidate Sunny Virk blamed the \"excessive cost\" of the Metro expansion on \"over-engineering\".\nHe said \"there has been a holistic failure to deliver on time\".\n\"The Lib Dems take a positive approach and are the only party that will get the job done,\" he said.",

        "content": "More than six months into the devastating Gaza war, its impact on the Israeli and Palestinian economies has been huge. \nNearly all economic activity in Gaza has been wiped out and the World Bank says the war has also hit Palestinian businesses in the occupied West Bank hard. \nAs Israelis mark the Jewish festival of Passover, the much-vaunted \"start-up nation\" is also trying to remain an attractive proposition for investors.\nThe cobbled streets of Jerusalem's Old City are eerily quiet. There are none of the long queues to visit the holy sites - at least those that remain open. \nJust after Easter and Ramadan and right in the middle of Passover, all four quarters of the Old City should be teeming with visitors.\nJust 68,000 tourists arrived in Israel in February, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics. That's down massively from 319,100 visitors in the same month last year. \nWhile it may be surprising that any visitors pass through Jerusalem at a time of such tension, many of those who do are religious pilgrims from across the globe who will have paid for their journeys well in advance.\nZak's Jerusalem Gifts was one of only a handful of stores on Christian Quarter Street in the Old City, which is situated in occupied East Jerusalem, to have bothered opening up on the day I passed by.\n\"We're only really doing online sales,\" says Zak, whose business specialises in antiques and biblical coins. \n\"There are no actual people. The last week, after the Iran-Israel escalation, business dropped down again. So we are just hoping that after the holidays some big major miracle will happen.\"\nIt's not just in Jerusalem's Old City that they need a miracle.\nSome 250km (150 miles) further north, on Israel's volatile border with Lebanon, almost daily exchanges of fire with Hezbollah since the war in Gaza began have forced the Israeli army to close much of the area and 80,000 residents have been evacuated further south. A similar number of Lebanese have been forced to leave their homes on the other side of the border.\nAgriculture in this part of Israel is another economic sector that has been hit hard.\nOfer \"Poshko\" Moskovitz isn't really permitted to enter his avocado orchard in the kibbutz of Misgav Am because of its proximity to the border. But he occasionally ventures in anyway, walking wistfully among the trees, to gaze at all of his \"money falling on the ground\". \n\"I must go to pick in the orchard because it's very important for the next season,\" Poshko says. \"If I don't pick this fruit, the next season will be a very poor one.\"\nHe says he is losing a lot of money because he can't pick the avocados - around 2m shekels ($530,000; £430,000) this season, he says.\nAlthough they provide a living for thousands of people, agriculture and tourism account for relatively small parts of both the Israeli or Palestinian economies.\nSo what does the wider picture show?\nLast week ratings agency S&P Global cut Israel's long-term ratings (to A-plus from AA-minus) reflecting a loss of market confidence after increased tensions between Israel and Iran and concerns the war in Gaza could spread across the wider Middle East.\nThat loss of confidence was also reflected in falling Israeli GDP - the total value of goods and services produced in the economy - which decreased by 5.7% in the last quarter of 2023. Many Israelis though say the country's renowned high-tech and start-up sector is proving to be more \"war-proof\" than expected.\nThe coastal city of Tel Aviv is only 54km from Jerusalem. More pertinently, perhaps, it's less than 70km from Gaza. \nAt times, you'd be forgiven for forgetting - however momentarily - that Israel is embroiled in its longest war since independence in 1948.\nFamilies make the most of the early summer sun to play in the surf, couples eat lunch in the many open-air beach restaurants and young people strum away on guitars on the green spaces between the coastal road and the Mediterranean.\nThe backdrop is a city that is economically active and physically growing fast.\n\"They joke that Israel's national bird should be the crane - the mechanical kind!\" says Jon Medved, founder and CEO of the online global venture investment platform Our Crowd.\nAn engaging character with an overwhelmingly upbeat view of his world, Medved tells me that, \"in the first quarter of this year, almost $2bn was invested in Israeli start-ups…  We're having one of the best years we've ever had. People who are engaged with Israel are not disengaging.\"\nMedved insists that, despite everything, Israel is still the \"start-up nation\" and a good option for would-be investors.\n\"There are 400 multinational corporations that have operations here. Not a single multinational, has closed its operation in Israel since the war.\"\nTo an extent, Elise Brezis agrees with Mr Medved's assessment.\nThe economics professor at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv acknowledges that despite the last quarter's GDP figures, Israel's economy remains \"remarkably resilient\".\n\"When it comes to tourism, yes, we have a reduction in exports. But we had also reduction in imports,\" says Brezis. \"So in fact, the balance of payments is still okay. That's what is so problematic is that from the data, you don't really feel that there is such a terrible situation in Israel.\"\nBut Prof Brezis detects a wider malaise in Israeli society that isn't reflected in economic data.\n\"Israel's economy might be robust, but Israeli society is not robust right now. It's like looking at a person and saying, 'Wow, his salary is high,' [...] but in fact he's depressed. And he's thinking, 'What will I do with my life?' - That's exactly Israel today.\"\nIf the outlook in Israel is mixed, then across the separation barrier that divides Jerusalem and Bethlehem the view from the Palestinian side is overwhelmingly bleak.\nTourism is especially important to the economies of towns like Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. \nWhile some people are still heading to Jerusalem's sites, in the place where Christians believe Jesus was born tourism \"stopped immediately\" after 7 October last year, says Dr Samir Hazboun, chairman of Bethlehem's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nThat's when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, taking about 250 hostages and sparking the current war.\nThere's huge dependence and reliance on Israel's economy here - but Israel virtually closed off the landlocked West Bank after 7 October and this has had a disastrous impact on the life and work of many Palestinians, Dr Hazboun says.\n\"The Bethlehem governorate right now is closed,\" he says. \"There are around 43 gates [in the Israeli security barrier] but only three are open. So with between 16,000 and 20,000 Palestinian workers from our area working in Israel, immediately, they lost their income.\"\nThe chamber of commerce says that the revenues from local Palestinians working in Israel amounted to 22bn shekels ($5.8bn) annually.\n\"You can imagine the impact on the economy,\" says Dr Hazboun, who is particularly concerned for the prospects for younger Palestinians the longer the war continues and more the Israeli and West Bank economies decouple.\n\"The younger generation now are jobless, they are not working. Many of them are talented people,\" he laments.\n\"In June I'm expecting around 30,000 new graduates from the Palestinian universities. What they will do? \nIn Gaza itself the economy has been completely destroyed by six months of war. Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have killed 34,183 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nUnlike in some parts of Israel, where there is optimism around being able to ride out the storm and continue attracting investors, in the West Bank and Gaza there is little hope things will return to any kind of normal.",

        "content": "I was halfway through my morning run when I heard it. The sound of the apocalypse. An air raid-style siren, slowly wailing up and down in pitch, was blaring over Belfast at 0830 GMT. I glanced at the sky.\nBut nobody else nearby seemed to be taking any notice. My wife, who had her earphones in, hadn't heard the noise at all until I pointed it out. It was the same at the supermarket on the way home. The din of the siren was audible across East Belfast, and yet, life continued as normal. \nThe bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel storage facility in Belfast Harbour. It is a fire alarm and has to be so loud partly because of the large size of the facility in question.The bizarre Belfast siren was, the BBC understands, associated with a fuel storage facility in Belfast Harbour. It is a fire alarm and has to be so loud partly because of the large size of the facility in question.\nThis kind of siren, so strongly associated in Britain with World War Two, is actually more than a century old, and has been used for all kinds of emergencies - not just Luftwaffe bombing raids.\nOther sounds and tones are sometimes deployed for outdoor alerts, but that lazily wavering siren that is so strange and chilling is still in place at multiple sites around the country - from military bases to chemical factories. Just in case.\n\"That wail pattern does a great job,\" says Evan Kerr, VP of operations at Sentry Siren, a US firm that still makes mechanical sirens. \"You need to get people's attention.\"\nHe explains that the sound is produced by a fast rotating fan inside a flat cylindrical housing, the outer rim of which is perforated with slits. It's the forcing of air through these slits, at oscillating speeds, that creates the extremely loud wail in all directions. \nThese days, this sound can be replicated by a digital recording played through loudspeakers but Mr Kerr argues that mechanical wailing sirens, which have been manufactured since at least 1905, are proven, reliable and nearly maintenance-free. He says some sirens made by his firm, previously known as Sterling Siren Fire Alarm Company, have been in place for many decades.\nIn the UK, there are air raid-style sirens in a number of locations. Notably, at the Royal Navy base in Portsmouth. This siren, which is tested regularly, would be used to warn members of the public about an accident with the nuclear-powered submarines that are stationed there.

There are no plans to change the emergency alarm system.\"\nSome siren locations are, perhaps, less obvious. Take The State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Carstairs, Scotland.

Take Hampton Water Treatment Works in West London - even it has a siren.

Take Hampton Water Treatment Works in West London - even it has a siren. \nIn Bradford, there is a siren at a large chemical plant owned by Solenis. In information sent to locals, the company explains why an accident might be harmful. A toxic cloud could form or, for example: \"A release of a flammable vapour, with subsequent ignition, may result in an explosion with the potential for damage both within the Solenis site, and outside its boundaries.\"\nAdvice from the company explains that, if people hear the siren when it is not due to be tested, they should shelter in their homes, close all windows and curtains, block incoming draughts, switch on the radio and \"stay calm and rest\".\nMore technology of business\nIn Huddersfield, chemical company Syngenta makes insecticides and other agricultural products. It too has a siren system in place to warn people in the event of a chemical emergency .\nThese are just some examples. There are dozens of outdoor warning sirens around the UK and many, though not all, use the familiar wailing pattern of a traditional air raid-style siren. One siren aficionado has even marked the locations of these systems on an online map. These are just some examples.

H&W confirms that this was not the case.\nThe incident raises the question: Would people react appropriately during a real emergency?\nPeople must be informed about what sirens in their area might be used for says Andrea Davis, president and chief executive of The Resiliency Initiative, a US firm that advises communities on emergency management. \n\"So [they] are familiar - 'Hey, I know this sound, it's not a scary sound, it's an action sound - I need to do something',\" she explains.\nFailing to activate a siren during an emergency could also be harmful. Mrs Davis criticises officials in Hawaii for not using outdoor sirens when a devastating wildfire hit Maui in August 2023.Failing to activate a siren during an emergency could also be harmful. Mrs Davis criticises officials in Hawaii for not using outdoor sirens when a devastating wildfire hit Maui in August 2023.\nErica Kuligowski, a social scientist at RMIT University in Australia, who has studied the efficacy of emergency warning systems agrees that sirens must be packaged with additional information that makes it clear what the warning is about, and what people should do in response. \n\"We need a series of pieces of information or else it's difficult to prompt people to act,\" she says.\nThe range of situations that might require a siren around the world are extremely varied. Sentry Siren, for instance, recently shipped five of its units to Iceland. They'll be used to alert people to volcanic activity, which has caused significant disruption in Iceland in recent months.The range of situations that might require a siren around the world are extremely varied. Sentry Siren, for instance, recently shipped five of its units to Iceland.

Countries neighbouring Ukraine, fearful of Russian aggression, are increasingly interested in such sirens, she adds: \"It is a constant threat.\"\nTelegrafia specialises in sirens that use digital recordings rather than mechanical components for producing noise. But this means the devices can blast verbal information across an area or turn text into explanatory spoken word announcements.\nThe company's sirens, which are installed in 93 countries around the world, can also be triggered automatically - for example by sensors detecting a flood. Or, a government could set off connected sirens across an entire country in the event of a nationwide emergency.\nThese days, sirens tend to make the news as false alarms, or when tests of siren systems are reported locally. Most of the time, thankfully, there's no emergency. There's always a risk that people will ignore these audible warnings when something really has gone wrong, however, which is why taking multiple steps to inform the public about an unfolding disaster or accident is so important, say experts.\nDespite the rise of alternative technologies such as mobile phone alerts, there is still huge demand for traditional outdoor warning sirens, says Mr Kerr of Sentry Siren: \"Why wouldn't you use all the tools available to you?\"",

        "content": "After Bitcoin's price banked a new all time high in March, the sticky subject of cryptocurrencies is back in the spotlight. \nAnd while crypto market-moving events such as Bitcoin \"halving\" or the launch of \"spot ETFs\" may be familiar to crypto fans, their meaning is less obvious to many.\nBut worry not.\nIf you're hearing these for the first time, or just need a refresher, here are a few key words and what they mean.\nWhile many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies - the dollar or pound, for example - Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile - rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers.  \nThroughout February and March 2024, its price rose rapidly and it briefly reached a new record high. But its value can plummet just as quickly as it spikes - a pattern which has been repeated multiple times since the cryptocurrency was launched.Throughout February and March 2024, its price rose rapidly and it briefly reached a new record high. But its value can plummet just as quickly as it spikes - a pattern which has been repeated multiple times since the cryptocurrency was launched.\nThe blockchain, the system that underpins Bitcoin, is sustained by rewarding so-called \"miners\" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency.\nHowever, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. \nSo roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin \"halving\" (or \"halvening\") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125.\nThis ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers.\nBlockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. \nEvery cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. \nThe incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.\nA crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, from their banks into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.\nA crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. It stores the virtual assets much like a traditional wallet holds cash. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USBs that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.\nEthereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. \nIt functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.\nETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies.\nA spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day.

        "content": "Lloyds Banking Group's profits plunged by 28% in early 2024 as competition grew for mortgages and deposits.\nThe bank posted pre-tax profits of £1.6bn between January and March, down from £2.3bn last year.\nLloyds said its margins had been hit \"mainly within UK mortgages\" amid heightened competition between lenders to offer squeezed buyers better deals.\nThe UK's biggest lender also made less from loans to businesses, but more from credit cards and car finance.\nThe group, which owns Halifax and Bank of Scotland, said in the three months to the end of March that its net interest income, which is the difference between the money it generates from loans and pays out for deposits, fell 10% to £3.2bn ($4bn). \nThe fall was expected as more people moved their cash into savings accounts with higher returns and mortgage rates eased because of the competition stepping up among lenders.\n\"The company has seen competition in the mortgage market bring down its returns and savers move deposits into higher interest accounts - meaning it is paying out more to customers, \" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\nLike other UK banks, Lloyds' profits were boosted by the increase in interest rates over the past couple of years, which have allowed lenders to charge more on loans. \nFor the whole of 2023, Lloyds' pre-tax profits jumped to £7.5bn, which was higher than expected and up 57% on 2022.\nBorrowing costs have risen as the Bank of England has increased its base interest rate in a bid to bring down inflation - which measures price rises over time.\nBut Mr Mould suggested that \"Lloyds' brief moment in the sun, when rates moved sharply higher and it was able to generate higher margins, seems to have come to an end\".\nIn January, competition for customers saw lenders cut rates sharply although borrowing to a buy a property has remained more expensive than many people have been used to in the past decade.\nThe Bank of England is expected to cut rates this year, but predictions of when such a move might take place has seen some lenders start raising mortgage rates in recent days.\nLloyds' rivals HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all raised rates on fixed-term loans, though not on all products, due to financial markets predicting an interest rate cut might not be as soon as previously expected.Lloyds' rivals HSBC, NatWest and Barclays all raised rates on fixed-term loans, though not on all products, due to financial markets predicting an interest rate cut might not be as soon as previously expected.\nLloyds said it still believed the Bank would cut rates by 0.25 percentage points three times before the end of 2024, which if happens, would see rates fall from 5.25% to 4.5%.\nOn Wednesday, the average two-year fixed mortgage stood at 5.83%, while the average five-year deal was 5.41%.  \nLloyds' latest results also showed the shift in more customers moving cash out of current accounts and into savings accounts had continued.\nThe group also said it had faced higher running costs in early 2024, including a new sector-wide Bank of England levy on lenders and a £100m additional charge to cover employee severance after a recent round of redundancies.\nIt confirmed it had not set aside any further cash to the £450m it has already allocated to cover the potential cost of an investigation into car finance deals by the UK's financial regulator.\nA probe into whether people had beenpaying too much for cars was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in January.A probe into whether people had beenpaying too much for cars was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in January.\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said while Lloyds' profit fall looked \"substantial from this time last year\", it had been expected.\nCharlie Nunn, Lloyds' chief executive, said the quarterly results provided the group with \"further confidence\" around its strategic ambitions and showed the bank was \"continuing to support customers\".\nAs well as announcing its latest earnings, Lloyds released forecasts for house prices.\nThe group said it expected house prices to rise by 1.5% in 2024 and average that amount over the next four years.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Heathrow Airport reported a huge rise in profits before tax of £189m for the three months to 31 March after recording a £60m loss for the same period last year.\nThe UK's biggest airport said some 18.5 million passengers travelled through it in early 2024, partly driven by growth on business routes to Delhi and Mumbai in India and strong North American traffic.\nIt has predicted this summer will be its \"busiest on record\", adding it had \"a robust operating plan in place to keep the airport running smoothly, even if unnecessary industrial action materialises\".\nHoliday firm Jet2 also said its summer season was 55% sold so far, with forward bookings for package holiday customers up by 13% and flight-only passengers up by more than 18%.",

        "content": "In February US company LanzaJet, which produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol, announced that it intended to build a second, larger plant on US soil.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was a \"big influence\", says Jimmy Samartzis, its chief executive.\nThe second plant would add to its facility in Soperton, Georgia - the world's first commercial scale ethanol-to-SAF plant.\n\"We have a global landscape that we are pursuing…[but] we have doubled down on building here in the United States because of the tax credits in the IRA, and because of the overall support system that the US government has put in place.\" \nSigned into law by President Biden in August 2022, the IRA, along with the so-called Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) enacted in November 2021, are intended, amongst other things, to funnel billions of federal dollars into developing clean energy. \nThe aim is to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and incentivise private investment, to encourage the growth of green industries and jobs: a new foundation for the US economy.\nWith a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (£310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology.With a 10-year lifespan, and a cost originally estimated at $391bn (£310bn) but now predicted to reach over $1tn - the final figure is unknown - the IRA offers new and juicer tax credits, as well as loans and loan guarantees for the deployment of emissions reducing technology.\nThe tax credits are available to companies for either domestically producing clean energy, or domestically manufacturing the equipment needed for the energy transition, including electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries.\nConsumers can also receive tax credits, for example for buying an EV or installing a heat pump. The tax credit for SAF producers like LanzaJet is new in the IRA and, offers between $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF (though it only lasts five years).\nComplementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (£61bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law. Complementary is the BIL, which runs for five years and provides direct investment largely in the form of government grants for research and development and capital projects. Under the BIL, about $77bn (£61bn) will go to clean energy technology projects, according to the Brookings Institution which monitors the law. \nOne company to benefit so far is EV battery recycling company Ascend Elements.\nIt has won BIL grants totalling $480m (£380m), which it is matching a similar amount in private investment to build its second commercial facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. \n\"[The IRA and BIL] are massive investments… larger than the infrastructure related provisions in the New Deal,\" says Adie Tromer from the Brookings. \"There is a clear sense that America has become more serious about transitioning to a cleaner economy.\"\nWhile rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments.While rules for some tax credits are still being finalized, tens of billions in actual public spending is flowing into the economy, says Trevor Houser at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, runs the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) to track US clean technology investments.\nAccording to recently updated CIM data, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government invested approximately $34bn (£27bn) into clean energy, the vast majority through tax credits.\nThe extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising.The extent to which the policy instruments are so far spurring not just announcements - of which there are plenty - but real extra private investment is harder to know: clean energy investment has been on a general upward trend anyway and the IRA hasn't been around long. But experts believe it is rising.\nTotal clean energy investment in the US in the 2023 calendar year including from both private and government sources reached a record $239bn (£190bn), up 38% from 2022 according to the CIM data.\nClean energy investment in the US, as a share of total private investment, rose from 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe IRA has had two main positive effects thus far, says Mr Houser. \nIt has \"supercharged\" private investment in more mature technologies which were already growing very rapidly like solar, EVs and batteries. \nIt has also, combined with the BIL, led to a \"dramatic growth\" in investment in emerging climate technologies like clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and removal and SAF. While the total magnitude of those investments are still relatively small compared to the more mature technologies, \"the IRA fundamentally changed the economics\" says Mr Houser.\nBut the IRA is failing to reach some parts of the green economy: so far it hasn't lifted investment in more mature technologies which have been falling like wind and heat pumps, though Mr Houser notes things may have fallen further without the IRA.\nOn the industry's mind is the fate of the laws, particularly the longer-to-run IRA, should there be a change of government in the US November elections. \nRepealing or amending the IRA (or BIL) would require Republican control of the Presidency, Senate and House - though wholesale repeal would likely face meaningful opposition from within. The rub is many of the projects that the IRA is incentivising are being or will be built in Republican states or counties. \nYet a Republican president alone could potentially frustrate things for example by slowing or deferring loans or grants, or amending the rules which serve the laws. \"A Trump presidency would definitely chill the atmosphere and possibly more,\" says Ashur Nissan of Kaya Partners, a climate policy advice firm.Yet a Republican president alone could potentially frustrate things for example by slowing or deferring loans or grants, or amending the rules which serve the laws. \"A Trump presidency would definitely chill the atmosphere and possibly more,\" says Ashur Nissan of Kaya Partners, a climate policy advice firm.\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank and purveyor of hard-right ideas for the next conservative President, advocates repeal for both the IRA and BIL.

And the point of the loans program is to take risks to help unlock new solutions that scale. \"It would be failing if there weren't any so called 'failures' within it,\" says Richard Youngman, of Cleantech Group, a research and consulting firm.\nMore technology of business\nMeanwhile, the US's approach is putting competitive pressure on Europe to do more.\nSome European clean energy manufacturing companies are now building facilities in the US to take advantage of the tax credits that otherwise would have been built in Europe including solar panel maker Meyer Burger and electrolyser manufacturers Nel and John Cockerill. \n\"The US wasn't a market for some of these companies in the past because Europe was more active,\" says Brandon Hurlbut, of Boundary Stone Partners, a clean energy advisory firm.\nThe EU's Net Zero Industrial Act (NZIA) is expected to enter into force this year. It doesn't involve new money, but seeks to coordinate existing financing and introduces domestic favourability for the first time - putting in place a non-binding target for the bloc to locally manufacture 40% of its clean energy equipment needs by 2030.\nIn the UK, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has made clear he isn't interested, nor can the UK afford to copy the IRA's approach in some \"distortive global subsidy race\" and will stick to other ways of helping.

        "content": "\"We do not intend to become the world leader,\" said Hungary's foreign minister in Beijing last October, about his country's ambitious plans for manufacturing Electric Vehicle batteries, \"because the world leader is China\". \nChina has an astonishing 79% share of the lithium-ion global battery manufacturing capacity, ahead of the US on 6%. Hungary is now third with 4% and aims soon to overtake the Americans, explained Peter Szijjarto, during his visit to China.\nWith 36 factories already built, under construction or planned, his words were no idle boast. \nViktor Orban's Fidesz government has trumpeted its \"opening to the East\".\nWhen it comes to maintaining strong economic ties with Russia, Budapest draws considerable criticism. More important in economic terms are the growing ties with China and South Korea. Electric vehicles are the cornerstone of that push, and for once Hungary is attracting the envy of fellow EU members, rather than their approbation. \nBy this summer, there will be 17 flights a week between Budapest and Chinese cities. In 2023, China became the single biggest investor in Hungary with €10.7bn.  \nLooking south from the tower of the Reformed Great Church in Debrecen, the solid grey building blocks of China's CATL factory stretch into the distance. The world's biggest battery maker has a big foothold in eastern Hungary.\nUntil last year sunflowers and oilseed rape painted the landscape green and yellow. Now the Chinese SemCorp separator foil factory and the Chinese EcoPro cathode plant have sprung up too. \nGo past the construction site of Debrecen's new, all-electric BMW factory and you will find another Chinese battery maker, Eve Energy. \nMeanwhile, bulldozers in southern Hungary are stripping the soil over a 300 hectare-site to prepare it for a Chinese \"gigafactory\" for BYD electric cars.\nSouth Korean and Japanese factories have already started manufacturing batteries or battery components here.\n\"Hungary is in the centre of Europe and in close proximity to the biggest industrial players in the automotive industry,\" says Noemi Sidlo from CATL's Hungarian division.\nIt was an obvious destination and the local and national governments were keen to help, she explained. \nMr Orban's Fidesz government has bent over backwards to attract Chinese investment, promising CATL €800m in tax incentives and infrastructural support to clinch the deal - more than 10% of the €7.3bn investment.\nAdd to that Chinese investment in a high-speed railway intended to connect Central Europe to the ports of Thessaloniki and Piraeus and Budapest's enthusiasm for Chinese investment is even clearer.\nThe feeling appears to be mutual. When Chinese President Xi Jinping comes to Europe in May, he will visit just three countries - France, Serbia, and Hungary.\nWhat could still go wrong for Viktor Orban's plans? \nRather a lot, say his critics. Environmental protests against the swathe of factories are growing, despite near-silence in the Fidesz-controlled media about potential problems.\nThe mayor of Debrecen, Laszlo Papp, has refused to talk to the BBC.\nRepeated emails to the foreign ministry and the Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency have gone unanswered. \nOpponents complain that there is no way to challenge the projects locally because they have been granted \"enhanced national interest\" status.\nSouth of Debrecen lies the pretty village of Mikepercs which has become increasingly dwarfed by construction sites.\n\"None of us mothers are against green cars,\" says local campaigner Eva Kozma, \"but it is incredibly unfair they built such an enormous factory here, without asking the local people.\"\nShe points to environmental issues caused by battery factories elsewhere in Hungary: \"That's not a green future if everyone here gets cancer, just because in other towns people who are luckier than us can flit around in their nice green cars.\" \nNoemi Sidlo from CATL insists her fears are ungrounded.\nWater supply is also a major headache in Debrecen.\nSituated on the Great Hungarian plain, rainfall is in decline, underground water supplies are depleted, and government plans have so far come to little to retain more of the waters that flow through the Danube and Tisza rivers.\nHungary risks trading its status as a water superpower, to become an electromobility superpower. Maps from the 19th Century show much of the current surface of the country covered in water.\nAnother problem is labour, in a country where unemployment is below 5%. \nCATL alone will need 9,000 workers, but the Hungarian government rides to power in election after election on a slogan of \"keep migrants out\".\nThe right-wing Our Homeland Movement recently highlighted the growing number of Turkish workers in Debrecen, building the BMW plant. \nAnother concern among critics is that cheap labour, cheap land, and generous government incentives will turn Hungary into a \"servant-state\" of Chinese and South-East Asian companies. \nThe government acknowledges there is a risk that wages will be kept low and domestic research and development will be affected.\n\"We have to convince the investors, not only to bring production here, but also research,\" Balazs Orban, political director of the Prime Minister's Office told the BBC. \n\"How we merge their research with the Hungarian companies. This is the biggest challenge for the upcoming 10 years.\"",

        "description": "For decades, India has been a nation of savers. They stash away a significant portion of their earnings for future security, often at the expense of current consumption. ",
        "content": "For decades, India has been a nation of savers. They stash away a significant portion of their earnings for future security, often at the expense of current consumption. \nBut something seems to be amiss now. Recent data from the Reserve Bank of India says India's net household savings stood at a 47-year-old low. Household net savings are the total money and investments families have, like deposits, stocks and bonus, minus any money they owe, like loans and debt.  \nSavings shrank to 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year 2023, down from 7.3% in 2022. One economist called this fall \"dramatic\".\nThere has also been a sharp jump in household debt in the same period. Annual borrowings stood at 5.8% of GDP - the second-highest level after the 1970s. \nAs households increasingly rely on debt to fuel consumption, their savings inevitably erode. The more they borrow, they dedicate more of their income to repaying debt, leaving less for savings. \nNikhil Gupta, economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, says a significant portion of India's increasing household debt is made up of non-mortgage loans. Farm and business loans comprise over half of these loans. (An interesting aside: In 2022, non-mortgage debt in India matched Australia and Japan, and surpassed many other major nations, including the US and China.)\nMr Gupta also found that while borrowing for consumption - credit cards, consumer durables, weddings, health emergencies, for example - makes up less than 20% of total household debt, it was the fastest-growing segment. \nSo what does this trend of low savings and high debt tell us about India's economy, the fifth largest in the world? Do increased borrowing and spending point to optimism for the future, or do they warn of challenges such as declining incomes, inflation and economic stress?  \n\"There is some amount of consumer confidence. There are many Indians who hope income growth will be strong enough in future. Or they just want to have a good life right now rather than think about what will happen to the future,\" Mr Gupta says.\n\"Is there a change in [the Indian] mindset about spending [more]? Maybe,\" he says, adding that it's not clear yet what is driving this.\nWhat about borrowing money out of necessity or desperation, typically during times of financial hardship or crisis? Extended distress borrowing could easily lead to loan defaults. On the other hand, if the lenders are doing their homework, why would they continue to lend to non-creditworthy borrowers in the throes of a financial crisis?\nA key problem, according to Mr Gupta, is the lack of granular detail in the official data on the borrowers. What kind of jobs they do? How many people have taken how many loans? (One borrower can take multiple loans.) What are they using the loans for? What is their repayment history? \nSome clues are available. Mr Gupta and fellow economist Tanisha Ladha at Motilal Oswal have found that the bulk of household debt growth in the past decade was driven by 'credit widening' - an increase in the number of borrowers - rather than 'credit deepening' or higher loans per borrower. Having more people borrowing is preferable to having each borrower take out larger loans.\nThey also found that Indian households have a debt service ratio (DSR) - the share of income used to service loans - of approximately 12%, similar to Nordic countries. This ratio is higher than that of China, France, the UK, and the US, all of which have higher household debt levels. The difference is due to higher interest rates and shorter loan tenures in India, resulting in a relatively higher DSR despite lower debt-to-income ratios.\nIn September, India's finance ministry dismissed fears about reducing savings and increasing borrowings, saying people were taking advantage of low interest rates after the pandemic to buy cars, education loans and homes. In September, India's finance ministry dismissed fears about reducing savings and increasing borrowings, saying people were taking advantage of low interest rates after the pandemic to buy cars, education loans and homes. \nAlso, it said, more people were borrowing to buy assets like home and vehicles which is \"not a sign of distress but of confidence in the future employment and income prospects\". \nZico Dasgupta and Srinivas Raghavendra of Azim Premji University, however, sound a note of caution. The decline in savings coupled with the increase in debt prompted concerns regarding \"debt repayment and financial fragility\", the two economists wrote in The Hindu.

The decline in savings coupled with the increase in debt prompted concerns regarding \"debt repayment and financial fragility\", the two economists wrote in The Hindu. \nOthers like economist Rathin Roy worry about a growing reliance on borrowing in a nation with the lowest per capita income among G20 countries. The government borrows to fund basic services and subsidies, while households borrow to consume, he noted in Business Standard. This reduces the already \"declining flow of financial savings\" and increases the cost of borrowing.Others like economist Rathin Roy worry about a growing reliance on borrowing in a nation with the lowest per capita income among G20 countries. The government borrows to fund basic services and subsidies, while households borrow to consume, he noted in Business Standard. This reduces the already \"declining flow of financial savings\" and increases the cost of borrowing.\nMr Gupta and Ms Ladha believe that the current high level of borrowing in a year does not endanger India's financial or macroeconomic stability. But there are concerns about its sustainability if this trend persists. \n\"Consumer India's consumption is located at the crossroads of high aspiration for a better life, woefully inadequate quality and quantity of public goods and amenities and modest incomes which are also unstable,\" writes Rama Bijapurkar, a business consultant, in her new book Lilliput Land. \nIn other words, the Indian consumer is engaged in a deft balancing act.

        "content": "Shoppers probably don't think much about what happens next when they place an online grocery order.\nBut it sets-off an intricate dance of software, artificial intelligence, robots, vans and workers.\nAt an Ocado warehouse just outside Luton, I'm in the middle of such a dance.\nAs far as I can see, hundreds of robots whizz around a grid, fetching items for online orders. They move with dizzying speed and precision.\nIn the early days of online shopping, when you placed an order, humans would dash around a warehouse or a store collecting your items.\nBut for years now, Ocado has been using robots to collect and distribute products, bringing them to staff, who pack them into boxes for delivery.\nAnd Ocado is not the only firm investing in such automation.\nIn its warehouses, Asda uses a system from Swiss automation firm Swisslog and Norway's AutoStore. In the US, Walmart has been automating parts of its supply chain using robotics from an American company called Symbotic.\nBack in Luton, Ocado has taken its automation process to a higher level.\nThe robots which zoom around the grid, now bring items to robotic arms, which reach out and grab what they need for the customer's shop.\nBags of rice, boxes of tea, packets of crumpets are all grabbed by the arms using a suction cup on the end.\nIt might seem like a trivial addition, but training a robot to recognise an item, grab it successfully and move it, is surprisingly difficult. \nAt Ocado around 100 engineers have spent years training the artificial intelligence (AI) to take on that task. \nJames Matthews, chief executive of Ocado Technology explains the AI has to interpret the information coming from its cameras. \n\"What is an object? Where are the edges of that object? How would one grasp it?\"\nIn addition the AI has to work out how to move the arm. \"How do I pick that up and accelerate in a way without flinging it across the room? How do I place it in a bag?\" he says.\nThe Luton warehouse has 44 robotic arms, which at the moment account for 15% of the products that flow through the facility, that's about 400,000 items a week. The rest are handled by staff at picking stations. \nThe staff handle items that robots are not ready for yet, like wine bottles which are heavy and have curved surfaces, making them difficult to grasp.\nBut the system is ramping up. The company is developing different attachments for the robot arms that will allow them to handle a wider variety of items.\n\"We're just playing it carefully and ramping slowly over time,\" says Mr Matthews. \"It's a deliberate constraint on our behalf, so we continue providing good service to people, and not crushed custard creams in every order, or worse, putting stuff on the track that goes under the wheels of one of the bots and creates an incident.\"\nIn two or three years Ocado expects the robots will account for 70% of the products. \nThis inevitably means fewer human staff, but the Luton warehouse still has 1,400 staff, and many of those will still be needed in the future.\n\"There will be some sort of curve that tends towards fewer people per building. But it's not as clear cut as, 'hey, look, we're on the verge of just not needing people'. We're a very long way from that,\" Mr Matthews says.\nOcado is hoping to sell its automation technology to companies outside the grocery sector. Late last year it announced a deal with Canada's McKesson, a large pharmaceuticals distributor.\n\"Think about which industries have the need to move things around efficiently inside of warehouse... it's endless,\" says Mr Matthews. \nMore technology of business\nSo where will the automation of warehouses end? Are we heading to human-free warehouses that can run 24 hours a day?\nNot so fast, says Sarah Bolton, who specialises in commercial real estate at law firm Taylor Wessing.\n\"It's almost prohibitively expensive, we're talking hundreds of millions of pounds to fully automate a warehouse,\" she points out. \n\"So you're really only talking about the big tenants in the really big warehouses looking at full automation, just because you have to have that size to make it anywhere near financially viable.\"\nShe also points that automation needs modern buildings, including floors that can stand heavy weights, large spaces without support columns, so there's less for the robots to crash into. Reliable electricity connections are also vital.\n\"You're reliant on new build, and there's a massive undersupply of new build warehouse stock in the UK at the minute,\" says Ms Bolton. \nAutoStore is tackling some of those challenges. It has a company called Pio which is developing automation for smaller businesses.\nIt uses much of the same technology that AutoStore supplies to big firms - robots buzzing around on a storage grid where goods are stacked vertically.\nHowever the upfront costs of Pio's system are lower, with the cost related to the volume of goods the system handles. The software is simpler and designed to integrate easily with common e-commerce systems like Shopify.\n\"It's a complete offering... where the upfront cost is very reduced. So it's quite affordable for these companies to get access to automation and start to get the benefits out of it. And since the technology is very flexible and scalable, you can continue to basically increase volume by adding more robots rather than more storage capacity,\" says Carlos Fernández, chief product officer at AutoStore.\nAt the moment 10 clients are running Pio's automation system with another five customers signed up.\nMr Fernández sees huge growth potential. \n\"Over the coming years, there's going to be a journey of making the technology simpler and more affordable. It won't require you to be a large corporation to run complex automation projects, and you won't need to invest big amounts of capital also to start getting the benefits.\"",

        "content": "A building society has said it will offer “voluntary” financial support to some of its customers who lost their savings when a trust fund firm went bust.Philips Trust Corporation (PTC) went into administration in 2022 leaving more than 2,000 people out of pocket.Some of those have argued Newcastle Building Society (NBS) bears some responsibility for them eventually ending up at PTC.However, at NBS’s annual general meeting this week, its head said it was not responsible for PTC’s actions but would offer “meaningful” support to some customers.\nChief executive Andrew Haigh said the firm could not share details about payments as it was working out \"where exactly this financial support will apply\".In the meeting, he said the building society considered the actions of PTC “worthy of consideration by the police”.NBS said it had been in touch with the police and stressed it never had a relationship with PTC and did not refer customers.\nGordon Crosthwaite said his mother-in-law Kathleen Birtley, from Northumberland, put about £105,000 into a PTC trust after initially being referred to the Will Writing Company by NBS. She hoped the money would be used to take care of her disabled son when she died, he said. But Mr Crosthwaite said he feared she would not get the money back.It was unclear what Mr Haigh meant by \"meaningful\" support and who would actually receive any money, he added. \"We'll wait and see,\" he said.\nThe BBC understands an entity connected with PTC took over the assets of the Will Writing Company, which went into administration in 2018 and whose services had originally been referred to customers by NBS.NBS maintains it wrote to customers to make clear it had no relationship to parties connected to PTC, after PTC acquired the assets of the Will Writing Company.Some customers said they had not received the first letter and argued they received a second letter too late to act on it.\nNewcastle solicitor Claire Springle said she believed some of her clients only ended up with PTC because they had accounts with the building society.NBS referred some customers the Will Writing Company to help them write wills and plan their estates, said Mr Springle.This firm then recommended some to its sister company, Family Trust Corporation (FTC), to help them put their homes and savings into trusts.Ms Springle said many of her clients, most of whom were older, did this because they thought they could avoid future care costs.\nWhen PTC took over parts of the Will Writing Company in 2018 several FTC customers switched the ownership of their trusts to PTC, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).When PTC took over parts of the Will Writing Company in 2018 several FTC customers switched the ownership of their trusts to PTC, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).After PTC went bust in 2022, it emerged it had moved its customers’ money to higher risk investments, the FCA said.NBS maintains PTC independently contacted customers inviting them to transfer to itself some less risky regulated trusts that had been set up by FTC.“This meant that, unfortunately, a lot of its customers face potential investment losses,” the regulatory body said.PTC's administrators, Kroll, said it held approximately 2,345 trusts.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

ByteDance insists it is not a Chinese firm, pointing to the global investment firms that own 60% of it.What to know about the US push to ban TikTokCan TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?\nExperts have told the BBC the bill is \"a big deal\" but have warned it faces multiple hurdles.It could take several years before the app is blocked as legal action, likely all the way to the Supreme Court, would delay the process.In November, a U.S. federal judge in Montana blocked an effort to ban TikTok within the state.The popularity of the app with young Americans could also be problematic.“About two in three young people in the US have a TikTok account,\" said Andrew Przybylski, professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University.“The primary challenge is going to be on freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\"The UN Charter on the Rights of the Child is quite specific: young people have a right to information and a right to play, so I think it can be challenged on those grounds.”Jennifer Huddleston from the Cato institute, in Washington, said any sale might be delayed because of the “considerable” regulatory scrutiny it would attract.\"Nine months is a rather quick timeframe for this size of a transaction - it's something that is likely to have further regulatory scrutiny even without the requirements in this proposal,\" she said.\"The question remains - what does it mean to even sell TikTok in the US, is that truly possible, and what would a buyer look like?\"Exactly who would be able to buy and operate it is also a big question - the price would likely be in the tens of billions of dollars, meaning there would be few potential buyers.\nBrooke Erin Duffy, associate professor of communication at Cornell University, said TikTok users in the US had been bracing themselves for a ban \"for quite some time\".\"The Senate decision injects a heightened level of uncertainty into the livelihoods of countless content creators, influencers, and small business owners,\" she said.If it is not sold in time, the app could be blocked in the country - the US says this is because it is concerned TikTok could be used to spy on Americans, or to spread propaganda.TikTok gathers similar kinds of data to other apps, but the US is concerned this data could fall into the hands of the Chinese government - claims the company has always contested.Elsewhere, the firm has agreed to suspend its TikTok Lite rewards programme, which pays users to spend time on the app in France and Spain.European Commissioner Thierry Breton said the feature was \"toxic and addictive\", particularly when used by children, and threatened to block it unless action was taken.The EU said its investigation into the feature would continue.",

The company also owns the Habitat brand.\nThe retailer said trading at Argos had been hit by last summer's wet weather, which affected sales of seasonal goods such as barbecues and paddling pools. \nThe weather also impacted clothes sales, as competitors launched sales to clear stock, and Sainsbury's said there had been some disruption to clothing supplies in recent months because of Houthi rebels attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\nAs Sainsbury's announced its results, a \"technical issue\" hit some of its online deliveries on Thursday.\nHowever, the retailer said the problem had been fixed, and had only affected a \"small number\" of customers.\nRead more tips hereRead more tips here",

        "content": "The first grand opera to be produced in Saudi Arabia has had its opening performance in Riyadh - part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's massively ambitious plans to shift the kingdom into a new era, economically and socially.  \nZarqa Al Yamama is the story of a blue-eyed tribal matriarch with the gift of foreseeing the future in pre-Islamic Arabia. \nHer predictions of imminent danger are ignored by her tribe - a story with a universal resonance according to Ivan Vukcevic, head of Arabian Opera. The company was set up in Switzerland to help develop the performance and teaching of classical music in the Middle East.  \n\"At its core lies the central female heroine with an extraordinary gift of foresight, advocating for reason and love in the face of adversity, even at the expense of her own life,\" he says. describing it as an epic tragedy familiar to many in the Arabic-speaking world.\nWhen the idea of a lavish new opera in Arabic was first presented two years ago, Mr Vukcevic and his company were initially taken aback and puzzled.\nThey wondered how the Arabic language, which is written from right to left, could be integrated into Western classical music notation which goes from left to right. But the standardised romanisation of Arabic helped resolve the issue.  \nThe Arabic libretto has been written by Saudi poet Saleh Zamanan, while the music is by Australian composer Lee Bradshaw.\n\"The brief, as I understood it, was this was to be a Western opera with an influence of Arabic and particularly Saudi music,\" Mr Bradshaw explains. \nHe said he used the rhythmic quality of Mr Zamanan's poetry as the basis for the music.\n\"I actually began the whole process by doing a rhythmic dictation of every line of poetry that we used in the opera. And that became the basis for the setting of all the vocal lines. And from there I sort of worked top down to orchestrate,\" he said.\nBritish opera singer Dame Sarah Connolly is playing the title role of Zarqa Al Yamama and says she had sleepless nights worrying about singing in Arabic. She spent months working with a Saudi language tutor.\n\"I felt listening to Lee's music that he's really beautifully made it recognisable using lots of Arabic sounds that they'll be used to hearing in popular music, various… musical tropes, recognisable modalities, and so on, and all instruments that they'll have heard before, like the Ney flute and the oud guitar,\" she said.\nPaolo Petrocelli, who is currently head of Dubai Opera, has played a key role in developing the art form in the Middle East and says that the creation of Zarqa Al Yamama is part of a wider trend in the region.\nHe says the wider Gulf region has \"witnessed a remarkable evolution in opera theatre\" that reflects a growing appreciation for performing arts. Investments in state-of-the-art venues and cultural initiatives have seen the region become a \"dynamic hub for opera\" that is able to attract top talent and stage immersive productions, he says.\n\"This development underscores the region's commitment to fostering artistic expression and enriching its cultural landscape.\"\nThere are opera houses in Cairo, Damascus, Muscat and Dubai and Saudi Arabia is also building a state of the art opera house as part of the redevelopment of the historic Diriyah district in Riyadh. \nThe Saudi investment in developing its cultural heft in the region and beyond matches similar efforts in sport and other sectors. And there's no doubt that there has been a genuine transformation - by no means welcomed by all Saudis - in many aspects of day-to-day life in the country.\nIn offices, universities and entertainment venues, Saudi men and women now mix freely, with no morality police to impose once strictly observed gender segregation. \nRiyadh now hosts months of lavish entertainment each year, attracting the biggest stars in the Arab world and beyond, in contrast to a decade or two ago when any public performance was vanishingly rare. Middle Beast, a huge rave event, takes place regularly on the outskirts of the Saudi capital - it's all now part of the fabric of Saudi society.\nConservative elements in the country have bemoaned the changes, while the less well off are to some extent excluded by ticket prices. Tradition remains powerful in the kingdom too, meaning that many young Saudis, particularly women, have yet to participate in this new Saudi Arabia.\nBut the new Saudi Arabia has also been accompanied by widespread suppression of dissent, with long prison sentences meted out to a number of Saudis who have expressed criticism on social media. \nAnd the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.And the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 still casts a dark cloud over the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince himself.\nThere's been plenty of controversy over the decision by world famous sporting celebrities, like Portuguese football star Ronaldo, to play in Saudi Arabia. Human rights groups have denounced it as \"sportswashing\" - using major sporting events or stars to divert attention from a country's conduct. Similar accusations have been made over stars in entertainment and culture. \n\"If Saudi Arabia is truly committed to 'social reforms', then the starting point should be investing in education, schools, healthcare, and basic human rights for people below the poverty line, among other necessities,\" says Maryam al-Dossari, a Saudi activist.\n\"While opera, cinema, and musical festivals are welcomed, they should not be the primary focus and merely designed to attract Western attention.\"\nSarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the human rights group Dawn - which was founded by Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed - is even more scathing.\n\"The Saudi government's all-out promotion of the country as a liberal, modern country with events like this opera show stand in such stark contrast to its cruel and repressive rule in the country,\" she said.\n\"It wants to be seen as a progressive government by dressing up as a progressive government without actually behaving like a progressive government.\"\nFor his part, composer Mr Bradshaw believes that the benefits music brings can transcend politics.  \n\"We came here probably 18 months ago to do some auditions and we saw hundreds of young Saudis auditioning for extra roles, for dancers, for acrobats, all manner of things, musicians,\" he said. \n\"And it was really amazing to speak to some of them who communicated very clearly to us that some of them never thought that they'd have an opportunity to do anything like this. And that really just galvanised in my mind the fact that we absolutely have to come here and do this. \n\"I think it's important that culture goes everywhere in the world because it is the strongest unifying force that we've got.\"",

        "description": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. ",
        "content": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. \nA hole in the ozone layer - the protective barrier of gas in the upper atmosphere - now lingers over the frozen continent for more of the year.\nA major cause of ozone loss is believed to be the amount of smoke from unprecedented Australian wildfires, which were fuelled by climate change. \nThe study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. The study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. \nClimate change biologist Prof Sharon Robinson told BBC News: \"When I tell people I work on the ozone hole, they go: 'oh, isn't that better now?'\"  \nScientists working in Antarctica discovered the hole in the ozone layer in 1985 - by measuring the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth. \nA large group of ozone depleting chemicals were responsible - primarily CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons - that were used as refrigerants. Every country agreed, in 1987, to phase out a group of ozone-depleting chemicals. It was an agreement known as the Montreal Protocol and is considered to be the most successful environmental treaty in history. \nThe ozone layer is now healing. \"But there's a hole - an area where the ozone layer is very depleted  - that appears every spring over Antarctica,\" Prof Robinson explained.\nThat ozone loss is particular to the polar continent, because of chemical reactions that occur in very low temperature, high atmospheric clouds. Those reactions break down ozone - eating a hole in the layer.     \nThe annual appearance of this hole usually peaks in September and October, when most land-based plants and animals are safely tucked away under snow cover and marine animals are protected by extensive sea ice.\nIt is now lasting through to December - well in to the Antarctic summer. \"That's when things will be exposed and most vulnerable,\" said Prof Robinson. \nCertain types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, called UV-B rays, increase the risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans, but researchers do not yet know if the same is true for Antarctic mammals and birds.\nIt's likely that anything covered by fur and feathers - seals and penguins - would be protected, explained Prof Robinson. \n\"But probably the biggest risk to the Antarctic animals is eye damage.\"\nIn their paper, Prof Robinson and her colleagues combed through all the studies they could find about the effect of UV on Antarctic plants and animals. \nThey found evidence of Antarctic mosses synthesising their own protective \"sunscreen compounds\". \n\"And if they're putting energy into sunscreen, they're putting less energy into growing,\" said Prof Robinson. \"There's always a cost to sun protection.\" \nThere is also evidence that krill - the small and hugely abundant marine creatures that are the foundation of the Antarctic food chain - move deeper into the ocean to avoid UV rays, which could affect the whales, seals, penguins and other seabirds that feed on them. \n\"We also know that the phytoplankton that the krill feed on will have to make sunscreens in order to avoid damage, said Prof Robinson. \nOne major reason for the longevity of the ozone hole is the vast scale and extent of Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020. \nJim Haywood, who is Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Exeter, told BBC News that the record duration of the Antarctic ozone hole over recent years was \"a wake-up call\". \n\"Society cannot be complacent about our achievements in tackling it,\" he said.\nBut there are still a number of factors that are delaying ozone recovery, including wildfires and major volcanic eruptions - these release particles that fuel the ozone-eating reactions that have already done so much damage. \nProf Robinson explained that some proposed climate-cooling experiments - so-called geoengineering - propose \"making clouds\" by releasing particles into the upper atmosphere. \n\"That would also deplete ozone, so it's a bad idea,\" she said. \n\"The biggest thing we can do to help Antarctica is to act on climate change - reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible so we have fewer bushfires and don't put additional pressure on ozone layer recovery.\"\nFollow Victoria on X, formerly Twitter",

        "content": "An important trial of the world's first \"personalised\" mRNA vaccine against the deadliest form of skin cancer - melanoma - is now under way in the UK. \nSteve Young, 52, from Stevenage, Herts, who had a melanoma growth cut out of his scalp last August, is one of the first patients to try the shot. \nIt is designed to help his immune system recognise and wipe out any remaining cancerous cells. \nAnd hopefully, that means his cancer will not return. \nThe jab, mRNA-4157 (V940), uses the same technology as current Covid vaccines and is being tested in final-stage Phase III trials.  \nUniversity College London Hospitals (UCLH) doctors are giving it alongside another drug, pembrolizumab or Keytruda, that also helps the immune system kill cancer cells.\nThe combined treatment, made by Moderna and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD), is not yet available routinely on the NHS, outside of clinical trials. \nExperts in some other countries, including Australia, are also trying it on patients, to gather more evidence and see whether it should be rolled out more widely. \nThe vaccine is personalised - meaning the make-up of it is changed to suit the individual patient. \nIt is created to match the unique genetic signature of the patient's own tumour and works by instructing the body to make proteins or antibodies that attack markers or antigens found only on those cancer cells.\nUCLH investigator Dr Heather Shaw said the jab had the potential to cure people with melanoma and was being tested on other cancers - lung, bladder and kidney tumours.\n\"This is one of the most exciting things we've seen in a really long time,\" she said.\n\"It is absolutely custom built for the patient - you couldn't give this to the next patient in the line because you wouldn't expect it to work.\n\"It's truly personalised.\n\"These things are hugely technical and finely generated for the patient.\"\nThe UK part of the international trial aims to recruit at least 60-70 patients across eight centres, including in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Leeds.The UK part of the international trial aims to recruit at least 60-70 patients across eight centres, including in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Leeds.\nThe patients on trial must have had their high-risk melanoma surgically removed in the last 12 weeks to ensure the best result. Some of them will get a dummy or placebo shot rather than the vaccine. None of them know which they are receiving though. \nMr Young is having his treatment in London. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 Today Programme, he said: \"[The trial] gave me a chance to feel like I was actually doing something to fight a potential unseen enemy.\n\"Scans showed I was radiologically clear, obviously there is still the chance I had cancer cells floating around undetected. \n\"So rather than just sit there and wait and hope it was never going to come back, I actually had this chance to get involved in putting on some boxing gloves and squaring up to it.\"\nThe musician had a lump on his scalp for many years before realising the growth was cancer. He said being diagnosed was a \"massive shock\". \n\"I literally spent two weeks just thinking 'this is it',\" he said.\n\"My dad died of emphysema when he was 57 and I actually thought 'I'm going to die younger than my dad'.\"\nCommon signs of melanoma to check for include:\nThe ABCDE checklist can help identify if a mole is abnormal:\nThese changes won't always be cancer, but it is important to get checked.\nThe earlier a melanoma is picked up, the easier it is to treat and the more likely treatment is to be successful. \nPhase II trial data, published in December, found that people with serious high-risk melanomas who received the jab alongside the immunotherapy Keytruda were almost half (49%) as likely to die or have their cancer come back after three years than those who were given only the drug.\nDr Shaw said there was real hope the therapy could be a \"gamechanger\", particularly as it appeared to have \"relatively tolerable side effects\".\nThese include tiredness and a sore arm when the jab was given, she said, adding that for the majority of patients it appeared no worse than having a flu or Covid vaccine.",

        "content": "A leader of students protesting the war in Gaza at Columbia University has apologised after video emerged of him saying \"Zionists don't deserve to live\".\nKhymani James, 20, said he was \"unusually upset\" and \"misspoke in the heat of the moment\".\nOn Friday, Columbia announced that he had been banned from campus.\nProtests which began at Columbia in New York City have since spread to campuses across the US.\nMr James, who has acted as a spokesman for the protesters, posted the comments to Instagram in January. He also said: \"Be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.\"\nThe comments were made both before and after Columbia administrators called him in for a disciplinary hearing.\n\"I don't fight to injure or for there to be a winner or a loser, I fight to kill,\" he said in a post. \nIn recent days, those comments were circulated by pro-Israel activists. \nOn Friday Mr James apologised, writing in a statement on X: \"I affirm the sanctity of all life and the movement for liberation.\"\n\"All people deserve to be safe from physical harm.\"\n\"Calls of violence and statements targeted at individuals based on their religious, ethnic, or national identity are unacceptable and violate university policy,\" the university said in a statement.\nA spokesman for the White House issued a statement condemning his remarks about Zionists.\n\"These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. \n\"It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews.\"\nSome of the campus protests on US campuses have been accused of antisemitism, and President Biden earlier this week condemned the \"antisemitic protests\".\nA number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations. \nOn Friday, the Columbia University Senate, made up of faculty and students, voted to admonish the university administration for its handling of the protests. \nCalling city police in to clear the encampment ran \"contrary to the norms and traditions\" of the university, the senate said. \nColumbia President Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik is facing pressure to step down over the response to the protests.\nThe latest wave of campus protests began after Columbia officials called in police to clear a protest encampment on 18 April and more than 100 people were arrested.\nActivists have been calling for universities to \"divest from genocide\" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting Israel's war in Gaza.\nIsrael is currently facing a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians, an accusation Israel has rejected as \"baseless\".\nAmong the recent developments:\nThe war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 34,180 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nAre you a student in the US?

        "description": "This is the first time that Buckingham Palace has said anything officially about the King's condition since revealing his cancer diagnosis.",
        "content": "This is the first time that Buckingham Palace has said anything officially about the King's condition since revealing his cancer diagnosis.\nSo it's a significant moment, breaking the silence with a positive message about his treatment and announcing, if not a complete return to good health, then at least the first green shoots of recovery.\nThere has been so much terrible news for the royals this year - the Princess of Wales as well as the King facing cancer - that this must feel like a badly needed change.\nLike the picture of the King and Queen in Buckingham Palace's gardens, there's a touch of summer after a long bleak winter.\nThe dramatic Buckingham Palace statement, which more or less came with its own drum roll, has created a much more optimistic mood. \nKing Charles is going to resume the type of big engagements that he's had to cancel all year.\nAnyone who has gone on a royal visit will have seen how much encounters with the public cheer him up, he's often shaking hands and swapping jokes with those he meets. He does literally seem to want to be a hands-on monarch.\nSuch encounters with ill health can readjust people's views and priorities and it will be interesting to see how it will affect the King. He's a thoughtful and deeply spiritual figure, who will now have another type of adversity to consider. \nIt's not a coincidence that his first visit next week will be to a cancer treatment centre where, with plenty of personal shared experience now, he will show his support for staff and patients.\nThe latest news suggests the King is well enough to host a state visit too, with the Emperor and Empress of Japan arriving in late June - an event which would usually involve the full royal red carpet treatment. These are the soft power moments where the King, as head of state, plays a pivotal role.\nThe last state visit was by the South Korean president and it showed the King's willingness to be creative with diplomacy, including having the band outside Buckingham Palace play 'Gangnam Style'. That was only before Christmas but it seems like a lifetime ago in royal news.\nRoyal commentator Richard Palmer, who has followed Charles's visits for many years, thinks the King will be keen to get his reign back on course.\n\"The King got off to a tremendous start in the new reign, much better than many royal watchers expected, but his and Kate's health problems have knocked the monarchy off course. He is a workaholic so I'm sure he has missed public-facing duties,\" said Mr Palmer.\nHe'll now have a second chance to start his reign.\nThe timing of the announcement might also have headed off some difficult questions that would soon have been arriving about the King's recovery.\nThere are a number of big royal summer events approaching - such as the garden parties, Trooping the Colour and the D-Day commemorations - which the King would have been expected to attend. There were overseas trips anticipated for the autumn too.\nDespite the latest mood music, there is still no certainty over whether he will be well enough to be at any of these events. \nThat it's not possible to say whether he will be at engagements only a few weeks away might be a salutary reminder that this is still an ongoing problem. There might be optimism, but it's cautious optimism.\nIt's understandable for medical matters to remain private, but when you scratch below the surface of the latest statement, there is still much that remains unclear and unknown.\nThe King's cancer treatment has not stopped and there is still no date set for its conclusion. As many families will have found, living with cancer means living with many uncertainties.\nIt isn't back to business as usual.\nIn terms of the statement issued by palace aides, the positive message will have got ahead of any speculation. It's set the narrative on a much more upbeat direction, with the King's doctors \"very encouraged by the progress made so far\", rather than a drip-drip of cancelled attendances.\nThe photograph of the King and Queen issued alongside has, as intended, sailed straight onto the newspaper front pages. It's a conscious message of cheerful reassurance.\nIt's very much a his-and-hers image, the royal couple sharing a moment. The Queen has been standing in for the King in a way that would never have been expected a few months ago.\nAuthor and historian Sir Anthony Seldon says the photo is \"intriguing\" in how much it focuses on the Queen.\n\"Deliberately or not,\" he says the photo give the impression that the \"rock in the marriage\" is Queen Camilla.\n\"Whether or not he will lean on her even more on his return we will see,\" says Sir Anthony.",

A number of Jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at Columbia and at other universities, although other Jewish students have joined the demonstrations.\nMs Pelosi said protesters needed to think about their tactics, asking: \"What is their message, what is their purpose?\"\nShe rejected the suggestion from the current leader of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, that the National Guard should be sent in to deal with the protests.  \nUniversities have brought in police to force students to leave but some are negotiating with the demonstrators and say these talks are showing progress.",

        "content": "A Canadian province will recriminalise the use of hard drugs in public, partly rolling back a landmark policy meant to help tackle a deadly opioid crisis.\nBritish Columbia's decriminalisation project began in January 2023 as a three-year pilot programme. \nBut it has faced pushback over concerns around public disorder and drug use. \nPolice will soon have the power to again address drug use in all public places, including hospitals, restaurants, parks and beaches.\n\"While we are caring and compassionate for those struggling with addiction, we do not accept street disorder that makes communities feel unsafe,\" provincial Premier David Eby said in a statement announcing the change on Friday.\nIt is unclear when the new rules will come into force. The province said it is working with the federal government to \"urgently\" change the policy. \nBC is the only province in Canada where the hard drug decriminalisation pilot programme is underway. \nThe project allows adults to possess up to 2.5 grams of heroin, fentanyl, cocaine or methamphetamine without being arrested, charged or having their drugs seized, initially except around schools and airports.\nThe pilot is to run until 2026.\nBut under the new rules announced on Friday, police will now have the power to ask a drug user to leave an area, and seize their drugs, or arrest them \"in exceptional circumstances\". \nIt would not affect people using drugs in a private home or at supervised consumption or drug-checking sites.  \nMr Eby's government had initially tried to pass a law that expanded the public places where drug use was prohibited to include not just schools and airports but playgrounds and near homes and businesses.\nThat effort was blocked by the province's top court late last year over concerns it would cause \"irreparable harm\" to people who use drugs.\nMuch of North America is grappling with a deadly opioid drug crisis. \nFatal overdoses peaked above 112,000 in the US for the first time last year, while BC marked its own grim milestone of more than 2,500 deaths in 2023. \nThe deaths are fuelled by a toxic street drug supply laced with fentanyl and other products, of which a small amount can be fatal.\nBut decriminalisation has faced heavy scrutiny in BC after stories emerged of open illicit drug use in places like public parks and hospitals.\nPolitical opponents have called it a \"harmful experiment\" implemented without safeguards for the public - one that has \"utterly failed\" to reduce overdose deaths.\nIn testimony before a federal parliamentary committee this month, Vancouver's Police Deputy Chief Fiona Wilson said that police have been limited in their ability to respond to \"problematic drug use\". \n\"So, if you have someone who is with their family at the beach, and there's a person next to them smoking crack cocaine, it's not a police matter,\" she testified.\nIn April, the US state of Oregon reversed a decriminalisation policy that had been in place since 2020. \nThe policy was seen by many as the most liberal effort in the US to decriminalise hard drugs. \nLawmakers backtracked after overdoses continued to spike in the state and amid pressure from the public over people openly using drugs on streets, sidewalks and in front of stores.",

It is not where he is receiving treatment.\nAlthough he has been carrying out his private work as head of state, including the regular meetings with the prime minister, this visit will be his first official public engagement this year.\nAt an Easter Sunday church service in Windsor, he surprised the crowds by greeting well-wishers and shaking people's hands.At an Easter Sunday church service in Windsor, he surprised the crowds by greeting well-wishers and shaking people's hands.\nIn late June, the King will receive the Emperor and Empress of Japan in his role as head of state - the first official state visit by Japan since 1998.\nThe highlights of such visits usually include a state banquet at Buckingham Palace and a carriage parade, but there could be adaptations for this visit, depending on the King's condition.\nThe Royal Family has had a difficult start to the year, with the Princess of Wales also undergoing treatment for cancer.\nThey have also faced intense public scrutiny and social media speculation, and the palace will hope this more positive news draws a line under what has been a rocky time for the royals.\nSince his cancer diagnosis, the King has spoken of how moved he has been by all the messages and cards wishing him a good recovery, particularly seeming to enjoy some of the funnier cards.Since his cancer diagnosis, the King has spoken of how moved he has been by all the messages and cards wishing him a good recovery, particularly seeming to enjoy some of the funnier cards.\nOn Friday, Buckingham Palace said the King and Queen \"remain deeply grateful for the many kindnesses and good wishes they have received from around the world throughout the joys and challenges of the past year\".",

        "content": "An orphan orca calf that has been trapped in a lagoon for more than a month off the coast of British Columbia is finally free.\nThe orca had been stuck since 23 March after its mother died, sparking a huge rescue effort off Vancouver Island's west coast.\nRepeated efforts to coax or carry her out a narrow path to open water were unsuccessful.\nBut on Friday, the calf managed to swim out on its own thanks to high tide. \nThe escape marks a happy ending for the Ehattesaht First Nation, who led the rescue efforts and affectionately named the whale Kwee-sa-hay-is, meaning Brave Little Hunter.\nThe two-year-old female calf had been stuck in the tidal lagoon after her pregnant mother was stranded and later died on a sandbar. The lagoon is near the coastal village of Zeballos, located on a narrow inlet on Vancouver Island that flows out to the Pacific Ocean. \n\"Today the community of Zeballos and people everywhere are waking up to some incredible news and what can only be described as pride for the strength this little orca has shown,\" said Chief Simon John in a statement on Friday. \nChief John said the orca swam away at 02:30 local time (8:30 BST), \"during high tide on a clear and glass-calm, star-filled night\". \nThe 15-year-old mother's death was captured on video in March, and repeated attempts to save her at the time were unsuccessful. \nFor weeks after her mother's death, the young calf had been unwilling to swim through the narrow channel and under a bridge into open water, prompting a team of First Nations community members and federal marine mammal experts to come together to work on freeing her. \nThis led to several fruitless rescue missions. In one attempt, rescuers tried to catch the orca and move her using a sling. In another, they tried to communicate with her using recorded whale sounds to convince her to move.\nAt one point, a violinist from Nanaimo, BC tried to serenade the calf in a bid to entice her to swim away. \nChief John said protective measures are now being put in place to shield the calf from boats or humans in the area.\nThe focus now, he said, is on reuniting her with her family. \n\"Every opportunity needs to be afforded to have her back with her family with as little human interaction as possible,\" Chief John said.\nIn a briefing, with fishery officials and First Nations representatives, they said she was recorded emitting excited sounds after leaving the lagoon. \n\"It was incredible how vocal she was when she hit that deep open water,\" one said. \nOfficials say the young orca has a proven track record of successful hunting. She has been observed eating herring and birds while trapped in the lagoon. \nThe hope now is that she will be reunited with her pod, or find a pod containing relatives who might adopt her. \nA statement from the First Nations community said her successful escape will resonate for years to come and that it  reinforces understanding of the connections between humans, animals and the Earth. \n\"Events like these have a deeper meaning and the timing of her departure will be thought about, talked about and felt for generations to come,\" the statement said.",

        "content": "Dejected. That's how Jey Sushil, a student at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, says he feels. \nMr Sushil is still shaken by the death in February of fellow student Amarnath Ghosh, a 34-year-old classical dancer from India. Local police are investigating it as a homicide case.\nMr Sushil says he found out about Ghosh's death through a friend in India before receiving any information from his university.\n\"They told us after two days. Students are not very happy with the overall response. It's like, who cares about how Indians feel?\" \nGhosh was fatally shot off campus in a city street. The university clarified that it communicates a student's death only after law enforcement confirms the identity, a process that takes time, and with consent from the student's next of kin. \nCalling it a \"horrible tragedy\", the VC of Marketing and Communications at Washington University in St. Louis, Julie Flory said, \"We shared this sad news with members of our community as soon as we could and according to the wishes of Amarnath's closest contacts.\"\nThe St. Louis Police Department said it \"takes 48 hours to establish identity\" of the deceased and \"in many cases, much longer\".\nGhosh is among the 11 Indian or Indian-origin students who have died in the US so far this year, sparking fears about personal safety within the community. \nThe causes of death have varied, from hypothermia to suicide to shooting. Experts say there is no discernible link between these unrelated incidents. As each tragedy echoes through campuses, students carry on with their daily routines, balancing fears amid academic demands.\n\"We avoid going out after dark. We have identified places in the city that are unsafe in the evenings. What else can we do?\" Mr Sushil asks. \nLike him, others also complain that their universities do not report the deaths on time, and they find out about them through Indian media or from relatives back home. \nMohammad Abdul Arfath, 25-year-old student of Cleveland State University (CSE), was found dead earlier this month after he went missing in March.\nA student, who wanted to stay anonymous and joined the college at the same time as Arfath, said he found out about his death through a WhatsApp message from his parents. \n\"My parents reminded me that I have to stay on guard,\" he said.\nNearly 267,000 Indians enrolled in US universities in 2022-23 and the number is projected to reach a million by 2030. \n\"The desire, the draw or pull of an American degree is very strong in India and appealing to Indian families,\" says Rajika Bhandari, a New York-based education expert.\nSangay Mishra, an associate professor at Drew University in New Jersey, says there is no \"clear pattern\" that connects the deaths and that \"it's important to not fall into the trap of building an overarching narrative that it's happening because they're Indians\".\n\"I haven't seen anything which suggests that these are cases of racial hostility or attacks based on race.\"\nIndian parents say they try to maintain regular contact with their children.\n\"It scares us whenever we hear such kind of news sitting far away in India,\" says Meenu Awal, whose son studies at the University of Southern California.  \nMs Awal says that she's instructed her son to \"not retaliate\" even in a case of a robbery. \"I have told him to just give cash or whatever, and walk away.\" \nNeetu Marda from Jaipur city says she talks to her daughter at New York University every day and keeps her friends' phone numbers handy. \"I ask her not to go out alone with unknown people.\"\nStudents at different campuses also follow their own safety protocols.\nAnushka Madan and Ishika Gupta, co-presidents of the Association of South Asians at Tufts University in Massachusetts, say they have a set of common safety rules, which includes not walking alone on campus at night.\n\"Boston is generally pretty safe,\" Ms Gupta says. \"But we stay a bit more cautious right now, more aware of our surroundings.\" \nAlong with physical safety, universities are aware of the psychological impact on students.\n\"It's become clear that international students are increasingly facing mental health issues which are a combination of immense financial pressure and academic pressure to keep up their level so that their visa status is not affected,\" says Ms Bhandari, the education expert. \n\"It's a huge psychological burden when they're thousands of miles away from home.\"\nOthers note that the students, hailing from varied economic and cultural backgrounds, experience their time abroad differently.\n\"International students face unique stressors when they leave their support systems and navigate a new culture,\" says Reena Arora-Sanchez, executive director of communications at CSU.\nThe Indian embassy in the US offers guidelines for students to contact them and hosts regular online and in-person open house sessions.\nAt Georgia Institute of Technology, Pratham Mehta, the president of the India Club, says they've reached out to the institute's \"large Indian student population\".\nThere are various on-campus therapy services available, and the club also facilitates connections to the Indian consulate for students feeling unsafe. Additionally, CSU provides an app linking students to the university's police department and offers a free safety escort service for campus and nearby student housing.\nExperts say that security and law enforcement have always been an important factor for students while choosing colleges. \nIn February, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said, \"We are very committed to making sure that Indians know that the United States is a wonderful place to study and to be safe.\"\nBut the recent spate of deaths have brought the issue into sharper focus.\nAmerican universities know that there is a \"huge and growing appetite among Indian students to study abroad\", Ms Bhandari says. \"Institutions are in a tough place trying to capitalise on this interest but at the same time, there's a clear acknowledgement that there are very real concerns around personal safety.\" \nDespite uncertainties, the US remains a sought-after destination for students.\nSwaraj Jain from Jaipur is heading to New York University in August, brimming with excitement and a clear understanding of the challenges ahead.\n\"Everyone talks about gun violence and crime. I will have to be careful,\" he says. ",

More than a half of girls said they had drunk alcohol in the past 30 days.\nHarriet Strange, 30, from Kent started drinking alcohol when she was 14. \n\"My dad was an alcoholic so I think there's a chance that I may have done it because it was learned behaviour from him,\" she said.\n\"Once I started drinking it was a spiral of self-destruction.\n\"My friends were always older than me so I would get them to buy alcohol for me or I would take it from my house.\"\nHarriet would go to house parties when she was 14 or 15 and \"nobody would bat an eyelid, it was just normal\".\nShe said she knew from an early age that her relationship with alcohol wasn't like other people's.\n\"It got to the point where I wanted to drink vodka at school,\" she said.\n\"My father's death when I was 16 was really the catalyst of absolute self-destruct.\"\nShe has been sober for three-and-a-half years now and credits becoming pregnant with her daughter for saving her life.\n\"I know what it's like being a child of an alcoholic and I didn't want to give that to her.\"\nHarriet is now a recovery coach and volunteer for Nacoa, an organisation which provides support for those affected by a parent's drinking.\nHelena Conibear, from Talk About Trust, which educates children in schools about alcohol and other substances, said most children have their first drink in the family home.\n\"If teens think parents don't mind, they will drink outside the home,\" she said.\nOfficial health advice is that children and young people should not drink alcohol before the age of 18 and, if they do, not until at least 15. This is to protect their brains and their bodies, which are too young to cope with it.Official health advice is that children and young people should not drink alcohol before the age of 18 and, if they do, not until at least 15. This is to protect their brains and their bodies, which are too young to cope with it.\nThe report also looked at other substances used by adolescents.\nOn cannabis use, the report found more boys in Scotland had used the drug (23%) compared to all other countries surveyed. \nCannabis use has dropped and stabilised in recent years but some vulnerable children are still continuing to use it, said Dr Inchley.\nNo data on cannabis was provided for England.\nSmoking among children is much less common than it used to be - one in five 15-year-old girls said they had ever smoked a cigarette - but smoking rates are still higher among girls than boys in England and Wales. \nThe report confirmed that vaping rates have overtaken cigarette smoking in most countries, with nearly one in 10 11-year-olds saying they've used a vape at least once, rising to 26% of boys and 40% of girls by age 15.\nVaping rates in the UK are above average, compared to other countries. Even though vaping is thought to be much less dangerous than smoking, the risks of children breathing chemicals into their lungs are not yet fully understood. \nThe UK government has already introduced measures to clamp down on the promotion and illegal sale of vapes to under 18s. \nDr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said harmful substance use among children in many countries was \"widespread\" and \"a serious public health threat\".\nHe said children were constantly exposed to harmful products online and that video games were helping to make drinking, smoking and vaping seem acceptable and normal.\nThe report urged countries to introduce measures to protect younger generations, such as limiting the availability of nicotine and tobacco products, alcohol and a ban on advertising and promotion of any substances on mainstream and social media.",

If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. \nTikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. \nThe most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices.\nApp stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. \nIt would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs.\nThe bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. \nIt gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.\nTikTok has called the legislation an \"unconstitutional ban\" and affront to the US right to free speech.\n\"We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. \"Rest assured,\" he told users in a video, \"we aren't going anywhere\".\"We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,\" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. \"Rest assured,\" he told users in a video, \"we aren't going anywhere\".\nHe previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk.\nByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move.\nMany US creators and users have criticised the potential ban.\nTiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work.\nIn March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill.\nBut the deluge of \"confused\" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. But the deluge of \"confused\" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. \nSeveral politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.\nIt is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. \nTikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. \nIt is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.\nThe UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. \nThe BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.\nAt the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. \nUsers are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.\nThe Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.\nThis curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.\nCritics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system.\nThis can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing.\nBut popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users.",

His cancer was discovered incidentally during an unrelated procedure for an enlarged prostate. \nThe Palace has not revealed what kind of cancer the King has, or what treatment he has been receiving. \nHe began a \"schedule of regular treatments\" in February.\nAt statement at the time said: \"No further details are being shared at this stage, except to confirm that His Majesty does not have prostate cancer.\"\nThe King, who is 75, was recently treated for benign prostate enlargement.The King, who is 75, was recently treated for benign prostate enlargement.\nHe spent three nights at the London Clinic private hospital, after undergoing a \"corrective procedure\". \nFollowing the treatment, the Palace said the King would postpone his public engagements \"to allow for a period of private recuperation\".\nA \"separate issue of concern\" was identified during his treatment and was subsequently diagnosed as a form of cancer.\nHe received treatment for that second condition, as an outpatient.\nCancer occurs when cells in a specific part of the body divide in an uncontrolled way.\nThese cells can spread to other tissues in the body, including organs, which is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.\nUsually doctors will start by asking questions about your symptoms. They can do some tests and examinations too. \nThat could include blood tests and X-rays or other scans. Sometimes they take a small tissue sample, called a biopsy, to run checks on in the lab.\nOccasionally, as is the case for the King, cancer is found when people are going for medical checks for other things. \nCancer may also be diagnosed by tests prompted by screening. \nThe UK offers screening for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. Cancer screening looks for early signs of cancer in people without symptoms. Other tests then confirm the diagnosis. \nIn the UK, one in two people develop some kind of cancer during their lifetime.\nThere are more than 200 different types of cancer - the most common ones in the UK are breast, lung, prostate and bowel, according to the NHS UK website.There are more than 200 different types of cancer - the most common ones in the UK are breast, lung, prostate and bowel, according to the NHS UK website.\nEach cancer is diagnosed and treated in a particular way.\nAnyone can develop cancer, but the risk goes up the older we become because there's more time for cell damage to build up.\nMost cases of cancer are in people aged 50 and over.

In the UK, a third of all cases are in people aged 75 and over.\nThere are lots of different ways to treat or manage cancer. Much depends on the type of cancer and where it is. \nSome cancers can be removed by surgery, while chemotherapy drugs can be given into a vein or taken as tablets to kill cancerous cells.\nRadiotherapy is another option that is sometimes offered. It uses high energy rays to attack the cancer.\nNot all treatments can cure, however. \nStaging is a way doctors describe how big the cancer is and how far it has spread, which can help with deciding the best treatment. \nThere are different systems or ways used by doctors. \nFor example, staging can use numbers, where one refers to a small cancer that has not spread, compared to four, which means it is advanced and spreading around the body. \nThe chances of someone surviving cancer have significantly improved over the last 50 years, but the rate of improvement has slowed.\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, half of people diagnosed with cancer survive their disease for 10 years or more.According to Cancer Research UK, half of people diagnosed with cancer survive their disease for 10 years or more.\nCancer survival is usually higher in people diagnosed when they are under 40.\nHowever, survival with breast, bowel and prostate cancers are highest in middle age.However, survival with breast, bowel and prostate cancers are highest in middle age.\nIf you notice something that isn't normal for you, see a doctor. \nThat might include:\nThe symptoms you are experiencing may not be cancer, but it is important to get checked. \nFinding cancer early can often make it easier to treat.\nNot all cancers are preventable - we can't choose the genes we inherit, or change the age we are.\nBut there are some steps we can all take to reduce the risk of some cancers.But there are some steps we can all take to reduce the risk of some cancers.",

        "content": "Expanding the West Midlands' tram network carries an \"enormous cost\" that may prove difficult to meet.\nThat is the finding of a document seen by the BBC that sets out the project's significant challenges.\nAn analysis of the Metro system, which links Birmingham to Wolverhampton, states \"significant investment\" is needed if a rapid network is to be delivered.\nBut the document says the cost of one planned extension is \"prohibitive\".\nThere have already been several extensions and more are in the works.\nOne to Dudley and a second in east Birmingham are expected to cost at least £700m.\nBut these routes have been hampered by delays, economic pressures and rising costs, raising fears parts of the Metro expansion could be scrapped.\nThe challenges of delivery are underlined in a document that has been sent to the BBC in response to a Freedom of Information request.\nThe report is a business plan for a Very Light Rail (VLR) service, effectively a tram system, earmarked for Coventry.\nThe plan was supported by Transport for West Midlands - operator and owner of the Metro - which sets out therein the financial case for VLR in the city, making note of its experience of expanding the Metro network.\nThe body states in the document that such efforts have \"illustrated the enormous cost and lengthy timescale to deliver this mode of transit\".\nIt adds: \"Also, the cost of vehicles and infrastructure including track have incurred high costs to maintain the system.\"\nTransport for West Midlands says VLR could be delivered at \"potentially lower costs and shorter timescales\".\nBut the outlook for the Metro is more complex.\nElsewhere in the document, Transport for West Midlands says one extension to the Metro \"has been looked at extensively and business cases developed and while there is a strong case to deliver this, the cost to deliver this scheme is prohibitive\".\nThe name of the extension has been removed under a Freedom of Information exemption.\nLast year, in the case of the Dudley extension, the Express and Star newspaper reported the cost of linking Wednesbury to Brierley Hill had increased by 45%, from £449m to £650m.Last year, in the case of the Dudley extension, the Express and Star newspaper reported the cost of linking Wednesbury to Brierley Hill had increased by 45%, from £449m to £650m.\nAnd in Birmingham, the budget for the Eastside Metro extension has risen from £227m in 2020 to £245m this year. A temporary station is being installed because construction work on the track has been delayed by high speed rail network HS2.\nThe further extension of that line - to Solihull - had been forecast to cost about £700m, with that figure expected to rise if the plans went ahead.\nThe West Midlands Combined Authority, of which Transport for West Midlands is part, announced plans to deliver further Metro routes, or rapid bus services, last month.\nBut the rising costs raise questions about the use of public money to fund the move.\nOn 2 May, the local electorate will decide who is West Midlands mayor and leader of the authority, with the candidates setting out their plans for the Metro.\nAndy Street, Conservative, is seeking a third term and has pledged to \"forge ahead with new routes\".\nMr Street's campaign said his 2040 transport plan was \"a huge endeavour, requiring significant investment\".\nA campaign spokesperson said the region's average annual investment in transport had increased tenfold to £406m since Mr Street became mayor.\nThe transport pledges in Mr Street's manifesto had been \"fully costed\" and potential funding sources for Metro projects identified, the spokesperson added.\nLabour candidate Richard Parker has pledged to continue funding the Metro's expansion to Brierley Hill and to Solihull.\nMr Parker also claims his plans are \"fully costed and fully funded\", with a spokesperson adding Mr Street has a record of \"over promising and under delivering\".\n\"Project after project has been cancelled or delayed due to mismanagement of plans and no proper grip on costs,\" they said.\nThe costs of the Metro were branded \"extortionate\" by Reform UK's candidate, Elaine Williams.\nShe said there needed to be \"a total rethink on travel to deliver a fully integrated, efficient, safe and more effective transport system\".\n\"The Metro is wasting the people's money,\" she said.\n\"Buses are far cheaper to buy and run than the tram cars and ancillary equipment.\"\nThe independent candidate, Akhmed Yakoob, said the \"budgetary increases and delays\" to Metro extensions \"illustrate the dynamic nature of large-scale infrastructure endeavours\".\nHe described the \"overinflated cost\" of expanding the Metro as \"just another indictment on the Tory-led government which has mismanaged Brexit, the economy; and has presided over soaring inflation\".\nHe said the approach was too \"fragmented\" and argued using \"many different private construction companies was going to add to extra logistical and financial pressures\".\nHe said addressing these challenges required exploring alternative technologies like VLR, improving project management practices and prioritising how funding was used.\nThe campaign for the Green candidate, Siobhan Harper-Nunes, said \"innovation can play a part in getting the best bang for our buck\".\n\"This is why it was so disappointing that the Very Light Rail was not fully funded,\" her spokesperson said.\nBut the spokesperson added \"even the best value-for-money transport improvements will require significant investment for the scale of change we need\".\nMs Harper-Nunes called for \"London levels of investment\" in the region's transport.\nLiberal Democrat candidate Sunny Virk blamed the \"excessive cost\" of the Metro expansion on \"over-engineering\".\nHe said \"there has been a holistic failure to deliver on time\".\n\"The Lib Dems take a positive approach and are the only party that will get the job done,\" he said.",

        "content": "A former Boeing employee, who was found dead in March, accused the company of \"countless\" violations of US law in testimony given just before his death.\nJohn Barnett claimed the firm tried to \"eliminate\" quality inspections at a plant that makes 787 planes.\nThe former quality control manager had been giving a formal legal deposition against the plane manufacturer.\nThe 62-year-old's death after two days of testimony was from a \"self-inflicted gunshot wound\", officials said.\nBoeing says it was \"saddened\" by Mr Barnett's death, but said the issues he raised had been reviewed and addressed.\nThe aerospace giant's safety standards are currently under the spotlight, in part due to an incident in January when a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off.\nThe transcript of Mr Barnett's deposition has now been released by his lawyers. The lengthy document runs to more than 140 pages.\nMr Barnett had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before his retirement on health grounds in 2017. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he had suffered retaliation from managers after raising a number of serious safety concerns, a charge the company denies.\nThe bulk of Mr Barnett's deposition focuses on the period from 2010 onwards, after he had moved from Boeing's facility in Everett, Washington to what was then a brand-new factory in North Charleston.\nThe plant had been set up to help assemble the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nMr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible.Mr Barnett had previously told the BBC and others that managers there had routinely ignored formal procedures in order to build planes as quickly as possible.\nIn his deposition, he provided more detail on these allegations, in support of his legal complaint that he had been \"denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn\" by senior managers, who had subjected him to a gaslighting campaign, and created a \"hostile work environment\" as a result of his actions.\nA key part of his testimony focused on the alleged falsification of records relating to problems within the production process and in particular the logging of defective or substandard parts.\nHe claimed employees had been under pressure to circumvent established procedures, set out in Boeing's own Quality Management System, to save time. A common theme within the factory, he said, was: \"We don't have time to follow processes, we're building airplanes\".\nThis, he said, had allowed \"an awful lot\" of faulty parts onto the production line, while others had simply been lost. These included two large sections of aircraft fuselage, which \"weren't anywhere to be found\".\nIn one specific instance, he claimed a contaminated and faulty tube designed to work in an oxygen system had been removed from a scrap bin and might have been installed on an aircraft that was now in service.\nSuch parts normally had to be carefully sterilised to reduce the risk of unwanted chemical reactions. Without that, he said, there was a risk that if the system was activated, it could cause an explosion that would \"bring the whole plane down\".\nHe suggested that there had been \"countless\" occasions on which paperwork had been falsified, and agreed with his lawyer's suggestion that each violation of procedure amounted to a \"criminal offense and felony\".\nMr Barnett was also deeply critical of what he saw as a drive at the South Carolina plant to reduce quality control inspections, again to speed up the manufacturing process.\n\"So the push for probably the last 15 to 20 years at Boeing is to eliminate quality [inspections]\", he said. \"But when here in Charleston they put that push on steroids\".\nBoeing's own lawyers focused more on Mr Barnett's claims that he had been retaliated against, and appeared to question his assertion that his safety concerns had not been taken seriously at the time.\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Boeing said: \"We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing and our thoughts continue to be with his family and friends.\n\"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety\".\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\n\"To ensure the safety, quality and conformance of our products, we investigate all allegations of improper behaviour. We then work diligently to address them and make improvements.\"\nMr Barnett's lawsuit is expected to continue. It will be taken forward by his mother Vicky Stokes and his brother Rodney Barnett as representatives of his estate.\nThe case is now expected to go to trial in September.",

        "content": "When Mitsuko Tottori was named as the new boss of Japan Airlines (JAL) in January, it sent a shockwave across the country's corporate sector.When Mitsuko Tottori was named as the new boss of Japan Airlines (JAL) in January, it sent a shockwave across the country's corporate sector.\nNot only was Ms Tottori the carrier's first female boss, she had also started her career as a member of cabin crew.\nThe headlines ranged from \"first woman\" and \"first former flight attendant\" to \"unusual\" and \"no way!\"\nOne website even described her as \"an alien molecule\" or \"a mutant\", a reference to her having worked at Japan Air System (JAS), a much smaller airline that JAL bought two decades ago.\n\"I didn't know about an alien mutant,\" Ms Tottori  laughs as she spoke to me from Tokyo.\nIn short, she was not from the elite group of businessmen that the carrier had customarily appointed to its top job.\nOut of the last 10 men who held the post, seven were educated at the country's top university. Ms Tottori is a graduate of a far less prestigious women-only junior college.\nWith Ms Tottori's appointment, JAL has joined the less than 1% of Japan's top companies led by women.\n\"I don't think of myself as the first woman or the first former flight attendant. I want to act as an individual so I didn't expect to get this much attention.\"\n\"But I realise the public or our employees don't necessarily see me like that,\" she adds.\nHer appointment also came just two weeks after JAL's flight attendants were lauded for the successful evacuation of passengers from a plane that collided with a coast guard aircraft during landing.\nJapan Airlines Flight 516 burst into flames after the collision on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport.\nFive of the six crew on the coastguard plane died and captain was injured. However, within minutes of the collision, all 379 people on board the Airbus A350-900 had safely escaped.\nThe rigorous training of the carrier's flight attendants was suddenly in the spotlight.\nAs a former flight attendant herself, Ms Tottori learned the importance of aviation safety first hand.\nFour months after she became a flight attendant in 1985, Japan Airlines was involved in the deadliest single aircraft accident in aviation history, which killed 520 people on Mount Osutaka.\n\"Every member of staff at JAL is given an opportunity to climb Mount Osutaka and speak to those who remember the accident,\" Ms Tottori says. \n\"We also exhibit aircraft debris at our safety promotion centre so instead of just reading about it in a book, we look with our own eyes and feel with our own skin to learn about the accident.\"\nWhile her appointment in the top job came as a surprise, JAL has changed rapidly since it went bankrupt in 2010, in what was the country's biggest ever corporate failure outside the financial sector.\nThe airline managed to continue flying thanks to major state-backed financial support and the business underwent a sweeping restructuring with a new board and management.\nIts saviour was then-77-year-old retiree and ordained Buddhist monk, Kazuo Inamori. Without his transformational influence it is unlikely that someone like Ms Tottori could have become JAL's leader.\nI spoke to him in an interview in 2012. He did not mince his words, saying JAL was an arrogant firm that did not care about its customers.I spoke to him in an interview in 2012. He did not mince his words, saying JAL was an arrogant firm that did not care about its customers.\nUnder Mr Inamori's leadership the company promoted people from frontline operations, like pilots and engineers, rather than from bureaucratic posts.\n\"I felt very uncomfortable because the company didn't feel like a private firm at all,\" Mr Inamori, who died in 2022, told me. \"Many former government officials used to get golden parachutes into the firm.\"\nJAL has come a long way since then, and the attention its first female president is receiving is not surprising.\nThe Japanese government has been trying for almost a decade to increase the number of female bosses in the country.\nIt now wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020.It now wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020.\n\"It is not just about the corporate leaders' mindset, but it is also important for women to have the confidence to become a manager,\" says Ms Tottori.\n\"I hope my appointment would encourage other women to try things that they were afraid of trying before.\"",

        "content": "Elon Musk is visiting Beijing with media reports saying he aims to discuss enabling autonomous driving mode on Tesla cars in China.\nMr Musk wants to enable Full Self Driving (FSD) in China and transfer data collected in the country abroad to train its algorithms.\nFSD is available in countries including the US but not in China.\nThe news came after a US report tied Tesla's autonomous driving modes to at least 13 crashes, involving one death.\nDuring a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Mr Musk was quoted by state media as saying Tesla was willing deep cooperation with China to \"achieve more win-win results\".\nIn response, Mr Li told Mr Musk the Chinese market would \"always be open to foreign-funded firms,\" according to the reports.\nChina is Tesla's second-biggest market. Other carmakers such as Xpeng - headquartered in Guangzhou - have been attempting to compete with Tesla by rolling out similar self-driving functions in their cars. \nOn Sunday, Mr Musk described Chinese car manufacturers as \"the most competitive car companies in the world\".\nTesla has taken previously taken steps to reassure Chinese authorities about the rollout of FSD in the country, including establishing a data centre in Shanghai to process data about Chinese consumers in accordance with local laws. \nThe trip comes days after the US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was investigating whether a recall successfully addressed safety concerns relating to Tesla's driver assistance system. \nThe NHTSA said that despite requirements that drivers maintain focus on the road and be prepared to take control at a moment's notice when autonomous driving was enabled, drivers involved in the crashes \"were not sufficiently engaged\". The regulator's analysis was conducted before a recall Tesla said would fix the issue.\nTesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways.\nMr Musk has promised that Teslas will be able to act as autonomous \"robotaxis\" for years. In 2015, he said Teslas would achieve \"full autonomy\" by 2018. And in 2019, he said the company would have robotaxis operating by the following year. \nThis month, the Tesla chief executive said he would reveal the company's robotaxi in August. \nCritics accuse Mr Musk of consistently hyping up the prospects of full autonomous driving to prop up the company's share price, which has fallen on the back of challenges including falling demand for electric vehicles worldwide and competition from cheaper Chinese manufacturers. Mr Musk denies the accusations.\nTesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to drum up demand.Tesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to drum up demand.\n\"Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand,\" Mr Musk recently said on X, the microblogging platform previously known as Twitter which the billionaire owns. \nTesla recently reported a 13% fall in automotive sales to $17.3bn (£13.7bn) for the first three months of this year.\nOverall sales across Tesla dropped by 9% while its profits fell sharply to $1.13bn compared to $2.51bn for the same period last year.\nSo far in 2024, its share price has collapsed by 32%.",

        "content": "Every winter, architect Kevin Adams would perform his early morning ritual of devotion. Cloth in hand, he'd head to the stylish Crittall windows in the East London flat where he once lived - because these windows, though stylish, were also sopping wet.\n\"You'd know to expect it - you wipe it down, you open the window as soon as you can, you don't let it puddle or rot the sills,\" he says of the moisture that used to form on the single-glazing and thin steel frames of his windows when the weather was cold.\n\"I put up with it because I loved them. We do all kinds of things for love, don't we?\"\nNot everyone who has lived with vintage steel-framed windows feels so affectionate towards them, however.\nCrittall Windows became synonymous both with modernism - and condensation, which can lead to serious problems such as mould, says Mr Adams, a teaching fellow at the Edinburgh College of Art. \nWhile many consider such windows iconic and a key part of British architectural heritage, given today's high energy prices and rising awareness around the dangers of mould, efficient windows have become essential. Crittall, like all other companies in the glazing industry, has had to stay relevant to survive.While many consider such windows iconic and a key part of British architectural heritage, given today's high energy prices and rising awareness around the dangers of mould, efficient windows have become essential. Crittall, like all other companies in the glazing industry, has had to stay relevant to survive.\nThe firm, now based in Witham, Essex, has been manufacturing steel-framed windows since the 1880s. The frames Crittall developed could be mass produced, then simply cut and welded to fit an array of standard window sizes.The firm, now based in Witham, Essex, has been manufacturing steel-framed windows since the 1880s. The frames Crittall developed could be mass produced, then simply cut and welded to fit an array of standard window sizes.\nThe style was popular in both commercial and residential buildings during the 1920s and 1930s but also after World War Two, says Adams. \"Perfect for a post-war economy that was mass building without much money and with a shortage of materials,\" he explains.\nFactories and warehouses often benefitted from metal-framed windows - lightweight but strong steel meant the frames could be extra thin, allowing more room for glass, which let natural light flood through. Workers appreciated this - but so did the wealthy, who wanted light, airy homes.\nA large, art deco country house built by Walter Crittall in the 1930s was listed for sale last year at £1.65m. A large, art deco country house built by Walter Crittall in the 1930s was listed for sale last year at £1.65m. \nOn the Crittall factory floor today, there is a machine that dates to the 1920s. It is still used occasionally for gently bending steel frame sections into curved pieces, says managing director Russell Ager: \"It's an incredible piece of kit.\"\nBut the company has moved on in many other ways, he stresses, and nearby machines in the building are now state-of-the-art. \"We've done so much work to improve the thermal performance of the products,\" adds Mr Ager.\nToday you can get double and even triple-glazed Crittall windows. And crucially, the steel frames are now made with a thermal break, a glass fibre section of insulation within the frame that prevents heat escaping through its structure.\nThe lack of a thermal break is what made the older frames so prone to becoming cold when the weather outside was chilly. Cold glass and steel encourage moisture in the indoor air to condense.\nThe latest Crittall windows can achieve a U-value - a measure of their insulating performance - as low as 0.8, which is better than standard double-glazed windows.\nThey are heftier than the vintage versions but Crittall has retained the classic look of relatively skinny metal frames and rectangular or square panes of glass. TikTok and Instagram accounts focusing on home décor often feature windows such as this, though Crittall has many competitors now that make similar-looking products, admits Mr Ager.\nAccording to Mr Adams, in the post-war era, there weren't many other firms operating in the same market as Crittall in the UK. But that has changed. Many companies, including KJM Group and Velfac offer aluminium alternatives. And there are other steel window makers out there, too, such as Fabco.\n\"Most consumers… buy our product because they love the look of it,\" says Mr Ager. Business, at the moment, is good.\nDuring the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, Crittall's sales to residential customers seeking to improve their properties spiked by 30%. And while this was then followed by a decrease, currently the firm's orders in 2024 are up 20% on last year already, says Mr Ager.\nMore technology of business\nDated heritage installations reaching the end of their life present another opportunity. Crittall recently replaced 100-year-old windows that the firm had made for a building in Central London with new, energy efficient versions of the same products.Dated heritage installations reaching the end of their life present another opportunity. Crittall recently replaced 100-year-old windows that the firm had made for a building in Central London with new, energy efficient versions of the same products.\nThis kind of upgrade is not accessible to all, however, because of the relatively high cost of contemporary glazing, notes Claire Bennie, director of Municipal, a housing design and development consultancy.\n\"Every year we have a chat about it at our AGM and everyone is afraid of taking the plunge,\" she says, referring to residents' meetings at the block of 1930s flats in London where she lives. The old Crittall windows in the property give the building \"elegance\", says Ms Bennie but also makes them \"freezing\".\nHer own flat's windows are not prone to condensation - but only because they are so draughty that they stay well-ventilated, she explains. \nIt will be increasingly difficult to justify the installation of new metal-framed windows in the future because of the embodied carbon in materials such as steel, says Ms Bennie. To reduce emissions and tackle climate change, sustainable timber building products ought to become more and more prominent, she argues.\nMr Ager says Crittall windows are made with 100% recycled steel and the company is working to make its products and operations as sustainable as possible.\nOther challenges facing the company in the coming years, include the possibility that building regulations in England will change, so as to demand extremely energy efficient windows in new build properties. Stricter standards could mean a need to make the frames thicker still and even better insulated, says Mr Ager: \"The frames would almost become unrecognisable. It would be a big issue for anybody that makes a metal frame.\"Other challenges facing the company in the coming years, include the possibility that building regulations in England will change, so as to demand extremely energy efficient windows in new build properties.

It would be a big issue for anybody that makes a metal frame.\"\nSustainability is paramount, stresses Ms Bennie, but she does say the ergonomic design of Crittall windows is hard to beat. The windows are often easy to open into a position where you can reach outside and clean them yourself, for instance. And the classic balcony doors made by the firm fold back neatly so as not to take up precious space outside.\n\"I wish modern window manufacturers would take a lesson from Crittall,\" she says, \"In how to make windows liveable and a pleasure to use.\" ",

It said homes contained an average of nine connected devices. \nAs well as basic broadband routers, that can include toys that are linked to the web, or home appliances like radiators, ovens and fridges that can be controlled remotely. \nHowever, since their adoption there has also been a proliferation of reports of hackers taking over such devices to misuse them, sometimes filming or recording covertly, spying on people, or stealing personal data.\nSarah Lyons, from the National Cyber Security Centre said firms making the products needed to take responsibility.\n\"Businesses have a major role to play in protecting the public by ensuring the smart products they manufacture, import or distribute provide ongoing protection against cyber-attacks and this landmark Act will help consumers to make informed decisions about the security of products they buy,\" she said.\nKen Munro a security researcher for Pen Test Partners a firm that carries out ethical hacking against smart devices, described the new law as \"a step in the right direction\".\n\"It's got teeth, which I love,\" he said.\nPreviously it has been too easy for manufacturers to end support for older products as they rolled out new models, he said, and it would be useful for consumers to be able to compare how many years of support were promised for the product they are purchasing.\nA longer support period suggested a manufacturer that was generally taking cyber-security seriously, he said.\n\"I think some device manufacturers at the bottom of the market might pay lip-service and do the bare minimum to make their products secure,\" he said.\nRocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which? said the new law would give consumers \"vital protections\".\nBut the Office for Product Safety and Standards should be prepared to \"take strong enforcement action against manufacturers if they flout the law\" he added.",

He argues that despite the referee's error the effort still met Opta's published definition of a shot on target. \n\"If the keeper didn't get a hand on it, it's a goal, therefore it's a shot on target, therefore my bet should've won,\" he claims.\nStats-based football bets are some of the most widely promoted by bookmakers. \nMany offer 'Bet Builders' that combine several data predictions into a larger wager. \nConnor, another bettor, needed Sunderland to make 14 or more tackles in their FA Cup tie against Newcastle to win his 'Bet Builder'.\nOpta recorded 13 and the bet was a narrow loser. \nHowever, replays appeared to show a tackle by Jobe Bellingham that had been mis-recorded as a blocked pass. \n\"It was a blatant tackle... I was in disbelief,\" Connor says. \n\"There's nothing that we can do about it, because there's no appeals process.\"\nWe showed these two incidents and five others to a football analytics expert.  \nDr Alireza Monajati, from the University of East London, assessed that in most cases the customers' concerns were valid.\n\"No data company asserts absolute accuracy,\" he added. \"Even with a high accuracy rate, say 95%, it implies a 5% margin of inaccuracy.\"\nNearly 300 people tried to appeal their football data bets to the Independent Betting Adjudication Service (IBAS) last year. \nIt made up around 15% of their workload.\nThe UK's biggest betting resolution body admits it is frustrated by the subjective nature of these markets, but it does not overturn the vast majority of cases. \n\"Our position is, if a bookmaker says we will settle bets based on what a third party declares, we think that is fair enough,\" says IBAS Managing Director, Richard Hayler.\n\"Our concern is that if the person who placed the bet thinks the data agency has made a mistake, there is not currently a mechanism for them to get the agency to have a second look.\"\nOpta is the third party data agency used by most bookmakers.\nPaddy Power, Bet365, William Hill, and many more bookmakers have terms that state Opta's statistics will be used to settle their data bets.\nOthers also use data from organisations like the Press Association or governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA.\nDifferent data providers often return different results.\nFor example, in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final, Opta recorded 30 'shots', whereas FIFA counted 31 'attempts on goal'.\nOpta's parent company, Stats Perform, said: \"We take the quality, consistency, and accuracy of our sports data incredibly seriously.\n\"We work tirelessly and are proud of our data collection people, processes and event definitions that underpin the trust in the B2B services we provide to the club, league, media and betting sectors. \"\nThey told us that their clients, including bookmakers, can contact a \"premium round-the-clock support team\" if they believe there is a data error.\nEnd users, such as betting customers, with a data query \"should raise it directly with the company producing the product they are using\".\nThey added: \"If a bettor is not satisfied with the response from their bookmaker,\" they will also review queries from the Gambling Commission and IBAS. \nThe Betting and Gaming Council, which represents most of the UK's betting companies, declined to comment saying that the mechanics of settling bets is one for individual operators.

She kept everything under wraps.\nThe Tortured Poets Department dropped last week with no singles released in advance and, next month, Billie Eilish says she'll be doing the same.\nFor years, commentators have been warning that the album is dead and the single reigns supreme.\nThat's partly down to streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music which let fans pick and choose their favourite tracks from artists and curate personalised playlists. \nBut could two of the world's biggest stars opting to ditch singles breathe life back into albums?\nAnnouncing Hit Me Hard and Soft, Billie said she wanted her fans to hear the album in one go.\nAnd in an interview with Rolling Stone, she explained why.And in an interview with Rolling Stone, she explained why.\n\"Every single time an artist I love puts out a single without the context of the album, I'm just already prone to hating on it,\" she said. \n\"I really don't like when things are out of context. This album is like a family: I don't want one little kid to be in the middle of the room alone.\"\nEven though he's responsible for the weekly Official Singles Chart, Martin Talbot, the chief executive of the Official Charts Company, admits he's more of an album fan himself.\n\"It's fantastic that Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift are doing what appears to be something designed to push music fans back to the concept of an album,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"There is a danger that music fans lose sight of what an album is and what an album represents.\n\"The album represents the kind of apex of the creative vision of a particular artist.\n\"And it's really important for the creative health of music and the cultural environment we preserve that.\"\nIn the 70-year history of the charts, Martin says collating the top 40 singles has changed dramatically. \nIt started with calling around a few record stores each week to ask which singles - specially selected and released by musicians - were their bestsellers.\nNow, thanks to streaming platforms, anything can be a single - and anything can enter the chart.\n\"The great thing about the digital environment is that it puts the control in the hands of the consumer, in the hands of music fans,\" Martin tells Newsbeat.\n\"Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift, they may just be releasing albums, but each of those tracks that make up those albums is available to stream in isolation,\" he says. \n\"And if those tracks get enough streams, they will go into the singles chart, regardless of whether the artist deems them to be singles or not.\"\nThat decision could be a thing of the past for artists as big as Taylor and Billie, although Taylor did release a music video for one song - Fortnight - on the day her album dropped.\nThat went straight to number one, but other tracks that weren't officially promoted, including Down Bad and the eponymous The Tortured Poets Department, also debuted in the top five.\nBut for up and coming talents like Beth McCarthy singles are as important as ever.\n\"Singles are a massive part of what starts your career,\" the singer tells Newsbeat.\n\"It creates a way to release music without the pressure of making a whole body of work and figuring out an entire sound. \n\"It lets people get to know you but in short, little bits rather than having to do the whole big thing.\"\nBeth, from London, will be performing at Radio 1's Big Weekend in May on the Introducing stage, and hopes to release her first album soon. Beth, from London, will be performing at Radio 1's Big Weekend in May on the Introducing stage, and hopes to release her first album soon. \n\"I've been doing singles and EPs because they're a shorter way to create something that isn't going full pelt into an album,\" she says. \n\"And for me, making an album, I want it to be done properly and done in a way that really works together and feels like art.\"\nAside from refining an artist's sound, another good thing about releasing singles is how they can get fans excited for a new album.\n\"The single is still one of the most powerful promotional tools for an album,\" says Martin.\nHe gives Texas Hold 'Em as an example, one of two singles Beyoncé released from Cowboy Carter which he says \"fed directly into the success of her album\" - which debuted at number one. \nBut Martin says for most artists, singles have an important role to play in keeping album sales high.\n\"Part of the job of releasing singles is to keep the album in the public eye and to continue to ensure that people are reminded it exists,\" he says.\n\"It's very easy to fall off the radar.\"\nVanishing from the limelight might not be a worry for Taylor, who within five days of releasing The Tortured Poets Department broke Spotify records with more than a billion streams. \nShe also broke UK chart records, with the album reaching number one and outselling the rest of the top 10 combined.\nCould it be the start of a comeback for the album?\nBillie's brother and collaborator Finneas suggested a return to listening to albums in full was due a comeback.\n\"We're not even at 'song' anymore,\" he told the magazine, saying music was increasingly being consumed in trending soundbites on TikTok. \nBut \"everything's a counter-movement to the movement,\" he added. \n\"I think that's going to lead back to immersing yourself in an album. I really do.\"\nTaylor and Billie aren't the first artists to shun singles, but Martin says it's an interesting coincidence to see two megastars take this approach at similar times. \n\"It won't be the last time they do it,\" he says. \n\"And it doesn't also mean the old model will die by the wayside and people are no longer going to start releasing singles.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

The Observer's Barbara Ellen wrote: \"It is television police drama refashioned as a long, dark night of the soul.\"The BBC One drama bagged six Bafta nominations, and Freeman won an international Emmy for his performance. The Observer's Barbara Ellen wrote: \"It is television police drama refashioned as a long, dark night of the soul.\"\nIt was a no-brainer for Freeman to do another series.\n\"It's lovely to do something you're dead proud of, because not everything you do ends up being a smasheroo,\" he says. \nIn series two, Chris is unwillingly entangled with local criminals, while his personal life gets steadily worse. His rookie partner Rachel Hargreaves is also struggling.\nFreeman says he thinks it is a realistic portrayal.\n\"It's sympathetic because it shows them as human beings who are really trying, in the worst possible circumstances, that most of us have no idea about,\" he says.\nHe thinks audiences, including some police officers, may appreciate Schumacher's unfiltered approach to putting their lives on screen.\n\"I hope the police who watch this go, 'Yeah, this is a flawed, three-dimensional character' - that's what we all are anyway,\" he says.\n\"It's certainly not an advert for the police. And it's not a pamphlet for how you should do police work.\n\"But when I watch drama, I just want it to be vaguely true, even if it's about a world I don't know about.\"\nHe says viewers, including himself, want a drama to show the \"tribulations of actual human beings rather than cardboard cutouts\", so authenticity is crucial.\n\"You smell lies, and you can smell it when it's off,\" he says.\n\"But when something seems humanly true, I think people appreciate that. \n\"It seems to be the case with this show.\"\nThe actor, who won a Bafta for BBC drama Sherlock, and starred in The Hobbit films, The Office and Love Actually, has also had police officers tell him: \"You all did that really well.\" \n\"The fact they came over, in order to compliment the show, suggests it definitely hit something in them,\" he says.\n\"It's like the Scouse accent - if the Scousers think I've done OK, they'll let me know, because if they didn't like it… \" He then shrugs and laughs. \nThe show's writer, Tony Schumacher, also finds this pretty funny. But luckily for Freeman, his accent has been praised as \"flawless\".The show's writer, Tony Schumacher, also finds this pretty funny.

Schumacher, who was in the police force in Liverpool for a decade, based Chris's character on himself. \nThe job became too much for him after he was badly assaulted twice on duty, and needed surgery for an injury. He had a breakdown and quit, becoming a taxi driver, and then a writer.\nHaving exorcised many demons in series one, he still felt a pull to return to the show.\n\"Everything I write is exploring how I feel about it, it's a way for me to figure things out about myself. It's cathartic,\" he says.\nThis is why he is happy to mine his own experiences, although he and Chris don't share plotlines.  \n\"I think, as a writer, you should be dipping your pen in your own head. It's cheaper than therapy,\" he laughs.\n\"In my office in Liverpool, there's a therapist next door. I know every time she walks past me, she must think, 'Oh God, there's somebody in there that I could get my hands on'.\"\nSchumacher is keen to portray life in the force as he sees it, saying: \"I always say this isn't a police drama, it's a people drama, a kitchen sink drama. \n\"I couldn't write about bobbies walking up and down a corridor spilling coffee. Not interested.\"\nA recent YouGov survey in The Times suggested more than half the public say they \"do not trust the police to solve crimes\" and more than a third say they \"have no faith in the authorities to maintain law and order\".A recent YouGov survey in The Times suggested more than half the public say they \"do not trust the police to solve crimes\" and more than a third say they \"have no faith in the authorities to maintain law and order\".\nSchumacher fully acknowledges that news stories exposing bad practice and crimes within the police affect public trust. Schumacher fully acknowledges that news stories exposing bad practice and crimes within the police affect public trust. \nBut his portrayal of Chris and Rachel shows them in a \"stressful job, dealing with complexities, dealing with people screaming in your face\".\n\"To have cuts, and the additional weight of public opinion swinging against the police - rightly so in many cases - it'd be wrong for me to not look at that and go, 'I need to reflect on people's feelings about that, the people who are doing their job',\" he says.\nAdelayo Adedayo plays Rachel, who suffers physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her firefighter boyfriend in series one.\nViewers praised her scenes, with one posting on X: \"The Responder, wow, well done BBC for highlighting domestic abuse occurs by professionals to professionals, it affects all walks of society.\" \nBy series two, Rachel is trying to move forward, but is still feeling the aftershock.\nAdedayo looked at \"the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder\", and spoke with women who run the Liverpool Domestic Abuse Service.\n\"It was really eye-opening, they talked about not being able to move on in your mind. So even though you've put physical distance between you and your abuser, it's toxic, because it's someone you loved,\" she says.\n\"You're still mourning a relationship.\n\"One of the symptoms women experience is hyperarousal [described by the NHS as being on edge and constantly aware of threats]. What a painful and difficult place for Rachel to be - she's a police officer, in situations where there's threats all the time.\"\"One of the symptoms women experience is hyperarousal [described by the NHS as being on edge and constantly aware of threats]. What a painful and difficult place for Rachel to be - she's a police officer, in situations where there's threats all the time.\"\nJosh Finan plays local character Marco, entangled in crime in series one, as a friend of Casey, the drug addict Chris tries to help.\nFinan, nominated for a best supporting actor Bafta for his role, says Schumacher's writing really rang true for him. \n\"After the first reading, I was like, 'Oh, this is Liverpool, this is the way people talk, there's a humour that's woven through that show.\"\nThe actor, who is from the nearby Wirral, explains that although \"Marco isn't me... he is a character I've sort of played in real life, when you're an insecure teenager\".\n\"I wasn't ever in as much trouble as him - but people I know were, and I was adjacent to it. \n\"That youthful, masculine world was quite real and apparent when I was growing up - and so you wear that costume.\"\nMyAnna Buring, who plays Chris's wife Kate, says series one did so well because \"it had its own voice... there was a poetry to the messiness of it.\"\nShe also thinks this show is distinct from many other TV police dramas. \n\"What's so interesting with this, as opposed to a procedural kind of police series, is it's character-driven, an emotional look at the life of somebody working on the front lines,\" she says.\nSchumacher concludes that the \"vast majority\" of police officers \"are doing the best they can - and sometimes their best mightn't be that great, but they're trying their best\".\nHe pauses, and says: \"I don't think I worked with anyone who didn't care.\"\nFreeman adds: \"I have to believe the vast majority of them are in it for the right reasons.\n\"They do things I don't want to do, and I'm glad someone does.\"\nAll episodes of series two of The Responder are available on BBC iPlayer from 06:00 BST on Sunday 5 May, with episode one on BBC One at 21:00 BST.

        "description": "For novelist Hanif Kureshi, growing up in the 1970s was all about hope and optimism - feelings well documented in his semi-autobiographical novel the The Buddha of Suburbia.",
        "content": "For novelist Hanif Kureshi, growing up in the 1970s was all about hope and optimism - feelings well documented in his semi-autobiographical novel the The Buddha of Suburbia.\nNow, over 30 years after the publication of his book, The Buddha of Suburbia is being adapted for the stage and Kureshi, along with theatre director Emma Rice, have been reflecting on one of the book's main themes.\n\"There was a sense that you could do anything or be anyone,\" Kureshi, 69, tells the BBC as he thinks about his own childhood. \"The racism was definitely more overt than it is today, but there was still a terrific sense of optimism - in fact it was the last age where people were hopeful of the future.\"\nKureshi first shot to fame in 1985 when his screenplay My Beautiful Laundrette - about the relationship between a British Pakistani boy and his white boyfriend - was nominated for both a Bafta and an Oscar.\nThinking about how different his childhood was to that of his sons, he says it is \"sad that young people have no hope anymore\".\n\"Hope isn't an empty dream, it means there is a possibility in the world that what you want can happen, and my kids don't think they will ever be able to buy a house or find lucrative work,\" he explains.\nPeople's desperation for hope is what prompted Emma Rice to bring The Buddha of Suburbia to the stage. \"Our show gives people that hope, it shows them that we can all live together and be happy.\" \nThe Buddha of Suburbia is set in the 1970s and tells the story of 17-year-old Karim who, against the backdrop of the winter of discontent, is desperate to escape the suburbs and immerse himself in the exciting opportunities that London presents.\nFirst released in 1990 it won the Whitbread book of the year award and was turned into a four-part television series by the BBC three years later.\nIt is now being produced for the stage by the Royal Shakespeare Company and Wise Children, and will run in Stratford-upon-Avon for six weeks. \nFor Rice, the show is all about the \"heart-breaking and joyful exploration of family, friends, sex, theatre and, ultimately, belonging\".\nIt's also a \"celebration of the 1970s, particularly the music and fashion\", so the setting has not been modernised. \nKeeping the original music, fashion and setting of a story set many decades ago can sometimes come with the risk of it feeling dated.\nLast year, a film version of Judy Blume's classic novel Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret was released.\nOriginally published in the 1970s, the story, which follows a pre-teen who is anxious about puberty and adulthood, was met with mixed reviews - a three star review by Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian said it \"does feel a little out of date\" and is \"played as a 1970 historical piece rather than being updated to the modern world\". Originally published in the 1970s, the story, which follows a pre-teen who is anxious about puberty and adulthood, was met with mixed reviews - a three star review by Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian said it \"does feel a little out of date\" and is \"played as a 1970 historical piece rather than being updated to the modern world\". \nBut neither Kureshi or Rice are worried about the relevance of the play.\n\"I'm not interested in being relevant,\" Kureshi says defiantly, but acknowledges that inadvertently the story does still have a cultural relevance to audiences today and is likely to appeal to young people.\n\"There's always been a struggle to get theatre out of the middle class ghetto, but I really think young people will be interested in understanding how our society got to where we are today,\" Kureshi says. \"And we have to remember that the 1970s were a turning point in British post war history - it shows the roots and beginnings of things we are living in now like immigration and fragmented families.\"\nRice, who was previously artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe, explains that there are also a lot of political parallels between the 1970s and now.\n\"Just like in 1979, we are on the edge of a general election and are potentially on the brink of massive change,\" she says, while Kureshi adds that he feels the country is in a \"more desperate and worse state now that in the 1970s\".\nKureshi and Rice have been working on this play together for a number of months, and for Kureshi, it's particularly special. \nThe novelist sustained life-changing injuries when he collapsed and landed on his head on Boxing Day in 2022.\nLeft without the use of his arms and legs, Kureshi has been treated in five hospitals and this is the the award-winning writer's first big project.\nThe pair speak almost daily, but because of Kureshi's condition he is unable to attend rehearsals or performances in person so he watches them via a live stream.\n\"I'm happy for her to take my book and do with it what she wants,\" Kureshi says about Rice. \"But I have warned her not to mess it up,\" he adds jokingly.\nRice, 57, who tells Kureshi that he is her \"hero\", says that what is lovely about their working relationship is \"that the long web of human friendships that the book explores, really does continue into real life\".\nTalking about his condition, Kureshi does not sugar-coat the reality of what he is going through. \n\"The suffering is absolutely immense and it never ends, but there have been some advantages of this trauma,\" Kureshi tells the BBC.\nThe most positive thing to come from his fall is his more profound relationship with his sons. \n\"I've started writing in a new way - I dictate sentences to my sons and then we rewrite them together,\" he explains. \nKureshi, who is working on a new book about his fall and its aftermath, says he never thought he could write with someone else, but he's had to adapt. \n\"The best thing is that I now get to see my sons every day - before we all led separate lives and would meet every now and again for a beer.\n\"Now our collaboration has an intensity to it, when you are writing you are raw and exposed and both me and my sons have had to get used to that.\n\"We are learning more about each other every day.\"\nDespite the devastating physical and emotional impact of his accident, it seems that some of the optimism and hope that his protagonist Karim feels, is starting to rub off on him. \n\"Emma and I talk about how lucky we feel - lucky to be doing this show together and also lucky to be here on this planet\".

Only four acts can claim more - The Beatles (16), The Rolling Stones (14), Robbie Williams (14) and Elvis Presley (13).\nBruce Springsteen also has 12 number ones, meaning Swift has also drawn level with The Boss.\nThe Tortured Poets Department was released last Friday as a 16-track standalone album. Two hours later, Swift surprised fans by issuing a second volume, titled The Anthology, containing 15 extra tracks.\nTaken as a whole, the project is a voyage through two tumultuous years of the star's personal life, as she has navigated heartache, criticism and the trappings of fame.\nIt was met with mixed reviews. Pitchfork's Olivia Horn said Swift was \"largely retreading old territory\", an accusation echoed by Rolling Stone's Larisha Paul, who said the star was \"going through the motions while running in place\".It was met with mixed reviews. Pitchfork's Olivia Horn said Swift was \"largely retreading old territory\", an accusation echoed by Rolling Stone's Larisha Paul, who said the star was \"going through the motions while running in place\".\nThe same publication's Rob Sheffield disagreed, calling the album a \"wildly ambitious... cathartic confession\" that could be the star's \"most personal album yet\".

Helen Brown in the Independent agreed: \"The whole album is a terrific reminder of the intense, personal connection Swift can conjure in song.\"\nFans either didn't mind about any lukewarm reviews or didn't care. The album has broken dozens of records in its first week of release. Here is a round-up of them:\nBy the end of Friday, The Tortured Poets Department had become Spotify's most streamed in a single day.\nFive days later, it was streamed for the billionth time - the first album ever to achieve that feat.\nNo other artist has notched up a dozen number one albums in the UK so quickly. \nSwift took 11 years and six months, starting with Red in October 2012. This surpasses The Beatles, who managed the feat in 14 years and one month between Please Please Me (May 1963) and The Beatles At Hollywood Bowl (June 1977).\nIn the US, Tortured Poets is projected to sell more than 1.8 million copies this week. \nOf those, 700,000 of those sales were on vinyl - breaking Swift's own record for the largest sales week for an album on vinyl since modern tracking began in 1991.\nHer previous record, of 693,000, was set just six months ago, with the release of 1989 (Taylor's Version).\nFortnight, which features guest vocals from Post Malone, is the both the first single and the first track on The Tortured Poets Department.\nLast Friday alone, it was streamed 25.2 million times - breaking the record for the song with the most plays in a single day.\nThe previous record was set on Christmas Eve 2023, when 23.7 million people played Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You.\nIn its first six days, Tortured Poets racked up 799 million streams across all platforms in the USA.\nThat easily surpasses Drake's previous record of 746 million with his 2018 release, Scorpion.\nIn the UK singles chart, Swift also holds the number one position this week with Fortnight. Two other Tortured Poets songs make the top five - with the title track at number three and Down Bad at four.\nSwift is stopped from having more entries in the Top 40 by a rule that only allows three songs from one artist to chart at the same time.\nIt was introduced in 2017 after all 16 songs from Ed Sheeran's album ÷ (Divide) charted inside the Top 20.

And to share the screen and the box office with a huge film like Barbie, that also deals with the experiences of women, it's got to be a good thing.\" \nPart of the reason There's Still Tomorrow might have struck such a chord in Italy, however, is that the heroine, Delia, (also played by Cortellesi) suffers violent physical and emotional abuse by her husband. In the film, Delia is a housewife and mother living in poverty in post-war Rome in 1946, the year Italian women first got to vote.\nHowever, the film's story resonates with contemporary Italian audiences. According to recent police statistics, 120 women were murdered in Italy in 2023, about one every three days. The report said just over 50% of them were killed by partners or ex-partners. A quarter of them were killed by their children - in 89% of those cases, their son.However, the film's story resonates with contemporary Italian audiences.

Her funeral was attended by thousands of people and her death triggered major protests and calls for more protection for women.  \nCortellesi says that her film partly attempts to explore a cultural mentality that she argues, \"has been going on for millennia\".\nSo-called \"crimes of passion\" were only criminalised in Italy in 1981 and in July 2023, judges in Rome made worldwide headlines when a school caretaker was acquitted of groping a 17-year-old schoolgirl, because the sexual assault lasted less than ten seconds. A \"brief groping\" become a trend on Instagram and TikTok in Italy, along with the #10secondi hashtag.So-called \"crimes of passion\" were only criminalised in Italy in 1981 and in July 2023, judges in Rome made worldwide headlines when a school caretaker was acquitted of groping a 17-year-old schoolgirl, because the sexual assault lasted less than ten seconds. A \"brief groping\" become a trend on Instagram and TikTok in Italy, along with the #10secondi hashtag.\n\"The subject of the killing of women is unfortunately very, very topical, especially in Italy,\" Cortellesi explains. \n\"But femicide is often the tragic end of something that didn't begin that way. What we don't know is the history that culminates in a horrendous act of violence and a death of a woman every 72 hours in Italy. We can only infer a history of violence which is often not even brought to the authorities before it escalates.\"\nThe director says that the themes of violence against women has been part of her scriptwriting for years, as well as in her stage and screen work as an actor, although she says she hasn't personally experienced it herself.\n\"I wanted to make a contemporary film set in the past in order to compare what's changed and what's stayed the same,\" she explains.\n\"We might now, as women, have certain rights and safeguards, but what hasn't changed in society is this mentality that distorts love and turns it into possession. That's why we need better education.\"\nThere's Still Tomorrow may be set in 1946, shot in black and white (a nod to classic Italian filmmakers of the period) and tackle a subject like domestic violence, but an ironic humour still pervades the story, something the filmmaker says she believes helped audiences relate to it.\n\"When I've written scripts in the past, I've used this same kind of language,\" she says. \"It's not comedy per se, it's using the language of comedy to talk about some very serious themes. I feel that by using humour you can usher in these topics. You know that people are going to hopefully empathise and take the side of your heroine, without me being confrontational in my cinematic language.\"\nWhen There's Still Tomorrow first premiered in Italy, English-language industry publication Screen Daily called it \"a sentimental tale of suffering and self-sacrifice\", adding that Cortellesi \"executes it with style\". \n\"The domestic violence… is at times, choreographed into a grotesque and startling dance,\" said Screen Daily critic Allan Hunter, adding: \"The more overblown romantic moments are undercut by… dry humour\".\"The domestic violence… is at times, choreographed into a grotesque and startling dance,\" said Screen Daily critic Allan Hunter, adding: \"The more overblown romantic moments are undercut by… dry humour\".\nOld-fashioned word of mouth is credited for the film's longevity and financial success, as well as the filmmakers taking the film on to regional towns and cities and holding extensive Q and A sessions alongside the film. \nCortellesi claims that 45% of her audience demographic in Italy were men, which she calls \"a great joy\".\n\"This was never meant to be a film against Italian men, it's an invitation to share and walk together down the same path in life. I really didn't want to alienate men from watching the film and think I was pointing an accusing finger at them. \n\"I think because of the tone of the movie and the way all the different characters were portrayed, men actually identified with the female characters, I could see it in the way they reacted during the film.\n\"A lot of men felt able to speak up in the Q and A sessions afterwards, and share their own stories, which I often found really moving.\"\nUltimately though, the actress and director calls her 11-year-old daughter her \"muse\" for the film, and says it could be described as \"a mother-daughter love story\".\n\"This whole project happened because I was reading her a book about women's rights, and my daughter couldn't believe that a time existed when our rights weren't in enshrined in law. So it occurred to me we needed to talk to younger generations that they have to realise their rights aren't a given,\" she says. \n\"Just because we achieve something, it doesn't mean it's going to be there forever.  I wanted, in a way, to start passing the baton to a younger generation.\"\nThere's Still Tomorrow is released by Vue Cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 26 April 2024.",

        "content": "Nicole Kidman has said \"it is a privilege to make films\" after being honoured with an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award. \nKidman, 56, is the first Australian actor to be given the highest honour bestowed by the organisation. \nThe Moulin Rouge actress was presented with the prestigious award by Meryl Streep in Hollywood. \nOther stars in attendance included her husband, singer Keith Urban, and Big Little Lies co-star Reese Witherspoon.\nAccepting the award in a floor-length shimmering gold Balenciaga gown, Kidman thanked all the directors she has worked with. \n\"It is a privilege to make films. And glorious to have made films and television with these storytellers who allowed me to run wild and be free and play all of these unconventional women,\" she said. \n\"Thank you for making me better at my craft and giving me a place, however temporary, in this world.\"\nDuring the ceremony, Kidman teared up as her husband said she showed him \"what love in action really looks like\" when his substance abuse problems emerged soon after they married in 2006. \n\"Four months into our marriage, I'm in rehab for three months,\" Urban said addressing Kidman and their two teenage daughters, who joined her on the red carpet for the first time. \n\"Nic pushed through every negative voice, I'm sure even some of her own, and she chose love. And here we are 18 years later.\"\nAustralian actors Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman and Cate Blanchett also gave video tributes to the first actor from their country to win the award. \nPrevious winners of the award, which the AFI calls the \"highest honour in American cinema\", include Streep, Julie Andrews, Denzel Washington, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. \nKidman made her Hollywood breakthrough alongside Tom Cruise in 1990's Days Of Thunder - marrying him in the same year.\nShe divorced him in 2001, but her stardom only grew after this.\nShe received her first Oscar nomination for Moulin Rouge in 2001, before going on to win the best actress Oscar for The Hours in 2003.",

There’s the Israel-Gaza war, Russia-Ukraine war. So it’s impacting people.\"But also there’s the daily struggles of life... the cost of living crisis where people have to choose between eating or heating. Life is difficult generally.\"This exhibition was for me to encompass the feelings of society. Loss, despair, frustration, anger...\"It’s a journey for me to find out who I am as an artist.\"\nMr Kneen has always enjoyed art but only took it up more seriously in the last six years, he said.The artwork in the new exhibition took him 14 months to complete and it is being displayed in chronological order.\nAs visitors move through the three rooms, they are invited to witness the evolution of the artist's distinctive style, from its experimental stages through to its final form.It uses a myriad of mediums, including expansive wooden boards, recycled cardboard, and even skateboards.The first room has the initial paintings mainly in black and white, while the second room showcases slightly more colours.But the third room \"offers hope\", Mr Kneen said.\"I take out the foot off the pedal and let the colours pop... it offers more positivity.\"I think everybody can relate to this concept of painting irrespective of who you are or where you are.\"Emotions really bring us together as a society.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

        "published_date": "2024-04-27",
        "authors": "Science correspondent, BBC News",
        "description": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. ",
        "content": "For Antarctic wildlife, exposure to the Sun's damaging rays has increased in recent years, scientists say. \nA hole in the ozone layer - the protective barrier of gas in the upper atmosphere - now lingers over the frozen continent for more of the year.\nA major cause of ozone loss is believed to be the amount of smoke from unprecedented Australian wildfires, which were fuelled by climate change. \nThe study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. The study is published in the journal Global Change Biology. \nUniversity of Wollongong climate change biologist Prof Sharon Robinson told BBC News: \"When I tell people I work on the ozone hole, they go: 'oh, isn't that better now?'\"  \nScientists working in Antarctica discovered the hole in the ozone layer in 1985 - by measuring the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth. \nA large group of ozone depleting chemicals were responsible - primarily CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons - that were used as refrigerants. Every country agreed, in 1987, to phase out a group of ozone-depleting chemicals. It was an agreement known as the Montreal Protocol and is considered to be the most successful environmental treaty in history. \nThe ozone layer is now healing. \"But there's a hole - an area where the ozone layer is very depleted - that appears every spring over Antarctica,\" Prof Robinson, who is deputy director of the university's Securing Antarctica's Environmental Future research centre, explained.\nThat ozone loss is particular to the polar continent, because of chemical reactions that occur in very low temperature, high atmospheric clouds. Those reactions break down ozone - eating a hole in the layer.     \nThe annual appearance of this hole usually peaks in September and October, when most land-based plants and animals are safely tucked away under snow cover and marine animals are protected by extensive sea ice.\nIt is now lasting through to December - well in to the Antarctic summer. \"That's when things will be exposed and most vulnerable,\" said Prof Robinson. \nCertain types of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, called UV-B rays, increase the risk of skin cancer and cataracts in humans, but researchers do not yet know if the same is true for Antarctic mammals and birds.\nIt's likely that anything covered by fur and feathers - seals and penguins - would be protected, explained Prof Robinson. \n\"But probably the biggest risk to the Antarctic animals is eye damage.\"\nIn their paper, Prof Robinson and her colleagues combed through all the studies they could find about the effect of UV on Antarctic plants and animals. \nThey found evidence of Antarctic mosses synthesising their own protective \"sunscreen compounds\". \n\"And if they're putting energy into sunscreen, they're putting less energy into growing,\" said Prof Robinson. \"There's always a cost to sun protection.\" \nThere is also evidence that krill - the small and hugely abundant marine creatures that are the foundation of the Antarctic food chain - move deeper into the ocean to avoid UV rays, which could affect the whales, seals, penguins and other seabirds that feed on them. \n\"We also know that the phytoplankton that the krill feed on will have to make sunscreens in order to avoid damage, said Prof Robinson. \nOne major reason for the longevity of the ozone hole is the vast scale and extent of Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020. \nJim Haywood, who is Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Exeter, told BBC News that the record duration of the Antarctic ozone hole over recent years was \"a wake-up call\". \n\"Society cannot be complacent about our achievements in tackling it,\" he said.\nBut there are still a number of factors that are delaying ozone recovery, including wildfires and major volcanic eruptions - these release particles that fuel the ozone-eating reactions that have already done so much damage. \nProf Robinson explained that some proposed climate-cooling experiments - so-called geoengineering - propose \"making clouds\" by releasing particles into the upper atmosphere. \n\"That would also deplete ozone, so it's a bad idea,\" she said. \n\"The biggest thing we can do to help Antarctica is to act on climate change - reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible so we have fewer bushfires and don't put additional pressure on ozone layer recovery.\"\nFollow Victoria on X, formerly Twitter",

The petition follows an open letter written earlier this month to the Environment Secretary Steve Barclay by six organisations calling for support and funding to clear the site, which began seeing issues with waste being dumped there in 2020. The Rescue Hoads Wood campaign group said community members would see as many as 20-30 trucks per day dumping waste at the woods at the height of the problem in July 2023. \nSome residents fear toxic liquid from the site could end up in the river and have reported a “nasty” rotting-eggs smell coming from the waste. A spokesperson for Rescue Hoads Wood said: \"I’ve even smelled it from my bedroom on one occasion. “It’s a feeling of being poisoned. And the only way when it’s here you can escape it is by leaving your property and leaving the area completely.”\nA spokesman for Ashford Borough Council said to date it had been “unable to establish that the issues have crossed the threshold of a statutory nuisance” but that it continued to \"liaise with the relevant agencies\" including Natural England and the EA.The EA reiterated that it was continuing its investigations into illegal fly-tipping at the site and was \"determined to keep one step ahead of criminals\". In January, when the EA closed the site, Kent Police's rural taskforce said: \"Fly-tipping is often linked to other forms of criminality and we are therefore assisting the Environment Agency and other partner agencies with their investigation and associated enforcement action.\"It also described the size and quantity of waste as \"shocking and totally irresponsible\".\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

        "content": "The UK's largest cider maker has chopped down a huge orchard, sparking fears for wildlife as it is a natural bird habitat.Heineken, which owns Bulmers cider, has levelled the orchard - the size of 140 football pitches - on the Offa's Dyke path in Monmouthshire.It wants to sell the land and blamed a surplus of apples and a slow down in demand for cider for the uprooting of thousands of trees at Penrhos Orchard, which were planted in 1997.Environmentalists are concerned about the effect on migratory bird populations, but Heineken insisted it had acted in accordance with the Wildlife Act.Environmentalists are concerned about the effect on migratory bird populations, but Heineken insisted it had acted in accordance with the Wildlife Act.\nPeople whose homes overlook the orchard, which spans several large fields, said they were \"sad\" and \"disappointed\" the trees had gone, but one said it improved the view of the surrounding hills.Ecologist Chris Formaggia has spent many years walking with his children on footpaths through the orchard. He has monitored the various birds that have been in the trees and is concerned about the future.\nHe said: \"At this time now all the trees would be in their full blossom. It would be a really impressive area so the changes are absolutely total, really.\"The biggest impact, he said, was on wintering thrush species such as fieldfare and redwing that eat autumn berries then move on to \"wind-blown apple crops\".\"So this orchard was absolutely teeming with these winter thrushes,\" he said. \"I think inevitably there will be a big loss here, particularly with those wintering populations. \"That foraging and that safety of the trees has gone and it’s not going to be replaced.\"\nHeineken said it was \"incredibly important that we act responsibly and sustainably at all times\" and the move was prompted by the slowing cider market and improved growing practices.The National Association of Cider Makers said 2,000 acres of British cider apple orchards had been lost in the past few years which, due to high tannin levels, \"have no other use than for making cider\".It said the amount of cider being drunk in the UK had dropped by a third over the past 10 years \"leading to this devastating loss of orchards\".\nDespite the challenges facing the UK cider industry, community orchards and small cider brewing businesses reflect a slightly different picture.Brewer Adrian Morales and partner Alys Williams opened their cider tap room in Talgarth, Powys, about a year ago.Since then they have also acquired an orchard next door which allows campers.Adrian said: \"I think we have to see orchards not only as a highly intensive source of apples but also as a source of more activity.\"I think it would be good to have more support from government bodies to encourage people to do that and diversify the orchards.\"Alys added: \"It’s all about an education of the product itself and stripping it of its stereotype as a cheaper alcohol that people used to go for.\"We love to bring our experience from north Spain and use different types of apples - not just cider apples but cookers and eaters as well - which creates a more acid-driven cider which can go really well with a cheese board and things like that.\"\nThe issues of trees has proved controversial recently, with the Welsh government consulting on plans to ensure farmers must grow them on 10% of their land to qualify for an important subsidy scheme.While ministers say this would help to tackle carbon emissions, many farmers suggested the scheme was unworkable, with 3,000 protesting at the Senedd in February.While ministers say this would help to tackle carbon emissions, many farmers suggested the scheme was unworkable, with 3,000 protesting at the Senedd in February.However, the scheme is voluntary so Heineken is entitled to cut down the trees on its land and, as it intends to sell it, it would be up to the next owners to decide if they wanted to plant trees if they used it as farm land.

Milne and his son Christopher Robin. \nNatasha Wakely, the zoo's archivist, said the project was \"an incredible opportunity for us to unearth the objects and material culture which bring to life our 200 years of history\".\nThe zoo, in London's Regents Park, had the first public fish house, insect house, reptile house, and built the first walk-through aviary. It also came up with the word aquarium, a portmanteau of aquatic and vivarium.\nIt was the first place to successfully breed a polar bear, called Brumas, in captivity and also has the only photographs of a living quagga - a zebra subspecies that is now extinct.\nThe zoo has had a number of famous residents:\nGuy became one of the zoo's best loved characters - when sparrows entered his enclosure, he would scoop them up gently and peer at them before letting them go. \nHe died in 1978 from a heart attack while having surgery on his teeth.\nObaysch was captured near an island in the Nile from which he took his name. \nAfter wintering in Cairo he arrived in London on 25 May 1850, becoming the first hippo to reach Europe's shores since the days of the Roman Empire.\nQueen Victoria inspected him shortly after his arrival and compared his swimming to that of a porpoise.\nWhen Goldie the golden eagle escaped in 1965, the story gripped the nation - even being mentioned in the House of Commons.\nFive thousand people caused traffic jams around Regent's Park as he flew from tree to tree. \nAfter 11 days and 19 and a half hours, he was finally recaptured and returned to the zoo.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "content": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the US is the only country that can stop Israel from attacking Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than a million people are taking refuge.\nMr Abbas, who runs parts of the occupied West Bank, said any attack could see Palestinians flee Gaza.\nIsrael has consistently vowed to carry out an offensive in Rafah.\nUS President Joe Biden \"reiterated his clear position\" on Rafah to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a call on Sunday.\nThe US has repeatedly said it cannot support a large-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah without seeing a credible plan to keep civilians out of harm's way.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Saudi capital Riyadh earlier, Mr Abbas - whose Palestinian Authority is not present in Gaza, which has been under Hamas rule since 2007 - urged the US to intervene.\n\"We appeal to the United States of America to ask Israel to stop the Rafah operation because America is the only country capable of preventing Israel from committing this crime,\" he said, adding that only a \"small strike\" on Rafah would force the Palestinian population to flee the Gaza strip.\n\"The biggest catastrophe in the Palestinian people's history would then happen.\"\nMore than half of Gaza's population is in Rafah and conditions in the overcrowded southern city are already dire, with displaced people there telling the BBC there was a lack of food, water and medication.\nWhile the White House did not elaborate on what specifically Mr Biden's latest comments to Mr Netanyahu were regarding the planning offensive in Rafah, national security spokesman John Kirby told the ABC network that Israel had agreed to listen to US concerns and thoughts before going in. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Riyadh where he will hold talks with Mr Abbas at the start of a new Middle East tour.\nMeanwhile, the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza, which have gained new momentum recently, have been further exposing divisions in Israel's governing coalition. \nWar cabinet member and opposition figure Benny Gantz on Sunday said that the current government \"would not have the right to continue to exist\" if a reasonable deal to return the hostages was not accepted.\n\"Entering Rafah is important in the long struggle against Hamas. The return of our abductees, is urgent and of far greater importance,\" Mr Gantz wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \nThe far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, however, said the government should resign if it accepted a deal in which the planned offensive in Rafah was cancelled. \nTheir comments come after Israel's foreign minister said that the country could suspend the incursion, which Mr Netanyahu has said is the next step in its battle against Hamas, if there was a hostage deal.\nThe Israeli military said its chief Herzi Halevi had approved plans to continue the war, with Israeli media saying this referred to the Rafah operation.\nLong-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar have largely stalled because of the gaps between the Israeli and Hamas positions, but on Sunday Hamas said it would send representatives to Cairo to give a response to the latest proposal.\nUS media have quoted unnamed Egyptian officials as saying the latest ceasefire proposal given to Hamas involved a several-week period of calm intended to lead to the end of the war, in return for the release of 20 hostages. \nHamas wants a permanent end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza, while Israel insists Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza and all hostages freed.\nEgypt and other Arab states have previously said an influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land.\nSatellite pictures have shown new tent encampments being built near the Gaza coast, to the west of Rafah and the city of Khan Younis slightly further north, which has been left largely in ruins. Media reports say the tents are to accommodate people displaced from Rafah.\nThe current war began when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. Some 133 hostages are believed still to be in Gaza, of whom about 30 are thought to be dead, after a brief truce in November saw some hostages released.\nThis week Hamas's armed wing released two videos showing the first proof of life of three hostages since they were abducted last October.This week Hamas's armed wing released two videos showing the first proof of life of three hostages since they were abducted last October.\nIsrael's campaign of aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza since 7 October has killed 34,454 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.\nOver the six months of war, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have entered and taken control of all of northern Gaza including Gaza City and most of central and southern Gaza including Khan Younis.\nThey have since withdrawn from almost all of those areas but troops remain stationed on a road Israel has built that separates northern and southern Gaza. \nHowever, Palestinians displaced to southern Gaza - where the Israeli military told them to go for their own safety earlier in the war - have been unable to return to homes further north, a key demand Hamas is making in ceasefire talks, and Israel has given no indication when they will be allowed to.\nMeanwhile, deadly Israeli bombardment has continued across Gaza, including in Rafah, with the Israeli military saying it has been striking launch sites for projectiles.",

        "description": "Mike Panza showed up early to a comedy benefit to support the Kennedy campaign for president.",
        "content": "Mike Panza showed up early to a comedy benefit to support the Kennedy campaign for president.\nWearing a Star Wars-themed shirt and queuing outside the Royal Oak Theatre in this Detroit suburb, he talked about what drew him to the one candidate in the 2024 race identifiable solely by his initials - RFK Jr.\n\"I'd like a return to the middle of the road,\" said Mr Panza, 44. \"His stance on health care is really appealing. Kennedy wants to make people healthy, he wants to make the country healthy.\"\nMr Panza, who works as an environmental officer, might sound like a disaffected Democrat. But when I ask who he voted for in 2020, he answers immediately: \"Trump.\"\nInterviews with dozens of Robert F Kennedy Jr supporters here point to a paradox about the independent candidate, one of the biggest wildcards in November's presidential election.\nConventional wisdom, backed up by some opinion polls, says that Mr Kennedy, a member of the country's most famous - and Democratic - political family, presents more of a threat to Joe Biden than to the Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nHowever, other recent surveys, interviews with supporters and a closer look at the issues that animate Mr Kennedy's base tell a different story - that perhaps Mr Trump is the candidate who should be more worried.\n\"Given the status of politics in Michigan right now, I would say he's probably more damaging to Trump,\" said Corwin Smidt, a politics professor at Michigan State University. \"But it's a very uncertain situation.\" \nMr Kennedy is consistently polling in the teens or high single digits, percentage-wise. By all indications he is the most popular independent or third-party candidate in decades.\nExperts say support for third-party candidates tends to decline closer to the election, and that Mr Kennedy is extremely unlikely to win the White House. Yet, because of the tight electoral map, his significant support has the potential to influence results in some states - including Michigan, a key battleground - and ultimately determine who becomes the next president.\nJust a few miles away from the comedy show, local Republicans in suburban Macomb County hold a pro-Trump rally every Sunday at a wide intersection surrounded by strip malls, fast-food outlets and a gas station.\nThis is hotly contested territory. Mr Trump carried around 53 percent of voters in Macomb, in both 2016 and 2020.\nBut in the last election, the share of the vote going to third-party candidates declined, allowing Joe Biden to improve on Hillary Clinton's slice of the vote by about 3.5 percentage points. It was one small piece that allowed Biden to flip Michigan back into the Democratic column in 2020.\nAt the gathering of a couple of dozen Republicans waving American flags and handmade pro-Trump signs, reaction to the Kennedy campaign ranged from guffawing bemusement to mild approval.\nPeter Kiszczyc is a regular at these rallies. He says he's glad that independent candidates such as Mr Kennedy Jr and left-winger Cornel West have entered the race.\n\"Some leftists will vote for them,\" said Mr Kiszczyc, 69, who emigrated to Michigan from Poland in the 1980s. \"Some things I like about RFK, some I don't.\"\nBut he was in deep agreement with one of Mr Kennedy Jr's most noteworthy - and controversial - issues. \"All of us support his position against vaccination,\" he said, gesturing at the small crowd of Trump fans. \nAfter a career as an environmental lawyer, Mr Kennedy headed the anti-vaccine organisation Children's Health Defense. Its support and fundraising skyrocketed - as did Mr Kennedy's profile - during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHis activism has put Mr Kennedy on the opposite side to most Democrats of a cultural and political divide that formed during the pandemic - and which was particularly acute in Michigan.\nIn April 2020, then-President Trump focused his ire on Gretchen Whitmer, the state's Democratic governor, for imposing lockdown measures, tweeting: \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" The state was the site of numerous protests against Ms Whitmer's Covid policies, including tense armed rallies at the state capitol.\n\"A lot of the anti-Whitmer voters went for Trump in 2020,\" said Mr Smidt, the Michigan State professor.\nHe noted that many Michiganders drawn towards Mr Kennedy's position on healthcare and vaccines tend to lean conservative - and thus would more naturally fall into Mr Trump's camp.\n\"Democrats in Michigan are not like Democrats in California,\" he said.\nA number of Kennedy supporters back at the theatre - who paid $99 each for a comedy ticket - declared that they were opposed to lockdowns, masks, and Covid vaccines.\n\"I think the whole pandemic was mismanaged,\" said Sara White, a 43-year-old mother who said she opposed school closings and vaccine mandates. Ms White described herself as a former Democrat - \"I voted for Obama,\" she said - but noted that in 2020, she cast her ballot for Mr Trump.\nThe evening began with a short campaign video made by the creator of Plandemic, a series of conspiratorial documentaries about Covid.\nThe jokes skewed towards issues on the Make America Great Again agenda, including poking fun at gender terminology, \"woke\" young people and National Public Radio. \nAfter the comedy, Mr Kennedy remarked: \"There are people outside tonight who worry that I'm going to take votes away from President Biden and get President Trump elected.\n\"And there are people who I run into every day who are worried that I'm going to take votes away from President Trump and get President Biden elected. And both of them think that's going to be the end of our republic… I think our democracy is stronger than that.\"\nMr Kennedy's \"pox on both your houses\" message resonates with Liz Glass, a 59-year-old self-described recovering Democrat who owns a deli in Boyne City, in northwest Michigan. She voted for Mr Biden in 2020, but won't again.\n\"I'm disgusted,\" she said in a phone interview. \"It seems like the two major parties just want you to hate the other one, more than they have anything to offer that's positive.\"\nBut Mr Kennedy looks unlikely to be able to take advantage of one the biggest issues for disaffected Democrats, including Michigan's sizable Arab-American population - the continuing war in Gaza. A staunch ally of Israel, he has rejected calls for a ceasefire.\nThe two main candidates are - for obvious reasons - attempting to paint Mr Kennedy as a natural ally of the opposite side.\nMr Trump has offered various opinions on RFK Jr, calling him \"Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine\" on his Truth Social account - but more recently calling him \"a Democrat 'Plant'\".\nThe interactions between the two have been even more complicated than that. Although Mr Kennedy is a frequent critic of Mr Trump, he claims that he was approached by allies to see if he would be interested in being Mr Trump's running mate. The Trump campaign has vigorously denied the claim.\nBrian Hughes, a senior Trump adviser, called Mr Kennedy an \"ultra-leftist\". \n\"Despite the dreams of the liberal echo chamber, Kennedy is an existential threat to Joe Biden not President Trump,\" Mr Hughes said in a statement, citing Mr Kennedy's views on taxes, fossil fuels and gun control. \"That's why Biden and his liberal cronies are desperately fighting to keep Kennedy off the ballot in several states.\"\nHowever, a recent NBC News survey indicated that 15% of Trump supporters would switch their votes to Mr Kennedy when presented with his name as an option - as compared to 7% of Biden voters. \nThat's a break from several previous polls which showed Mr Kennedy pulling more support away from Mr Biden.\nDemocrats are still worried about that possibility. Local Democratic activists protesting outside the fundraiser called him a \"spoiler\". And Democrats have mounted legal challenges to Kennedy's efforts to get on the ballot. In Michigan those have come to naught, as Kennedy recently gained ballot access after being nominated by the tiny Natural Law Party.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes took aim at the Kennedy campaign. \"The choice is clear this November, we must re-elect President Biden, and there are simply no alternatives,\" she said.\nAt this point in the campaign the overall effect of Kennedy's bid is unknowable, said Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation who has studied the history of third-party campaigns. \nBut, Mr Matthews said, his presence in the race could cause a number of surprises, not only in close battlegrounds like Michigan but states which seem relatively safe for either candidate. \n\"At a level of 8 or 9 percent - roughly where he is at in the polls now - his support could really jumble the outcome in a number of places,\" Mr Matthews said.",

He needs the support of at least one member of the opposition at Holyrood to survive the vote, which could take place as early as Wednesday.The parliamentary bureau, made up of the presiding officer and MSPs from the main parties, will decide this week when the vote takes place and normally gives two days notice.\nJettisoning the deal with the Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement, provoked a furious reaction from his former partners in government. He now faces two motions of no-confidence this week, one tabled by the Scottish Conservatives in his own leadership as first minister and another from Scottish Labour which would force his entire government to resign. The Greens are due to meet later on Monday but have repeatedly ruled out supporting him in the personal vote.The Scottish Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will vote against him. If nothing changes, that leaves the first minister facing a choice of defeat in a confidence vote or resignation in advance.\nThe SNP has 63 MSPs in the 129 seat parliament, so if the seven Green MSPs vote against him, he is reliant on support from the sole Alba party MSP Ash Regan to continue in his role. That would lead to a 64:64 tied vote in which case the presiding officer would be expected to vote to maintain the status quo. The motion of no confidence in him personally is not binding but if he lost he  would come under intense pressure to step down.If he lost the government vote, MSPs would have 28 days to vote for a new first minister or automatically trigger a Scottish parliamentary election.\nAlba, a rival pro-independence party led by former first minister Alex Salmond, has been outlining a list of demands that might persuade Ms Regan to support the first minister.At an emergency meeting on Sunday, Alba's governing body formally approved Ms Regan's plan to pursue the issues of independence, \"women's rights\" and the \"restoration of competent government\" in any negotiations.Mr Salmond told BBC News he was also looking for a move away from \"the culture wars\" and a shift towards the \"people's priorities,\" which he said were health, housing, transport, education and the economy.\nHe said he expected Ms Regan to hold talks with Mr Yousaf in the coming days.But a deal with Mr Salmond's party is opposed by many within the SNP, and could open up further internal divisions.A source close to Mr Yousaf told the BBC on Sunday evening \"there is going to be no deal,\" with Alba.The Scottish government has not confirmed a time for any meetings with opposition figures or even that they will definitely go ahead.\nTwo SNP MPs, Stewart McDonald and Pete Wishart, have come out publicly against the idea of a deal with Alba.One senior SNP figure told BBC News it would be intolerable for any SNP leader to be beholden to Mr Salmond, whose estrangement from the party he twice led is a source of bitterness all round.Even if he were to survive the vote of no confidence, Mr Yousaf's authority would be badly weakened. Liz Lloyd, who was chief of staff to Nicola Sturgeon when she was first minister, pointed out that while Mr Yousaf might himself survive on a tie, legislation including budgets \"can't pass without a majority\" in the Scottish Parliament. Liz Lloyd, who was chief of staff to Nicola Sturgeon when she was first minister, pointed out that while Mr Yousaf might himself survive on a tie, legislation including budgets \"can't pass without a majority\" in the Scottish Parliament. In other words, even if Mr Yousaf were able to continue in office with the support of his own MSPs plus Ms Regan, without votes from elsewhere in the chamber, he would struggle to govern.\nThe BBC has been told that there were talks between the SNP leadership and the Green leadership over the weekend but that they did not alter the Greens' position.Nor did the SNP's former Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, apologising to them on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.Co-leader Lorna Slater who, along with Patrick Harvie, was dismissed as a minister in Mr Yousaf's government at a short and \"pretty robust\" meeting in the first minister’s official residence, Bute House, early on Thursday morning, told The Sunday Show on BBC Scotland that the first minister \"has lost our confidence and lost our trust.\"She added: \"I cannot imagine anything at this point that could change that position.\"\nThe Greens are due to convene on Monday to decide whether or not to even accept Mr Yousaf's invitation to a meeting.They had been scheduled to meet next month to decide whether or not to continue in the power-sharing deal with the SNP after discontent among members about changes to gender healthcare and the abandonment of a key climate change target.Some Greens have expressed concerns that the Scottish government is considering implementing the recommendations of the Cass review on English gender healthcare. Some Greens have expressed concerns that the Scottish government is considering implementing the recommendations of the Cass review on English gender healthcare. A critic of the Greens' approach to that issue, and others, is Kate Forbes, the former finance secretary, a social conservative who came close to defeating Mr Yousaf in last year's leadership contest and could run again if he stands down.\nMs Forbes insisted this week that she was backing Mr Yousaf but she has used similar language to Mr Salmond's about \"getting back to the people’s priorities,\" such as creating wealth, improving education and fixing healthcare.Ms Forbes insisted this week that she was backing Mr Yousaf but she has used similar language to Mr Salmond's about \"getting back to the people’s priorities,\" such as creating wealth, improving education and fixing healthcare.As the leadership election demonstrated, thousands of party members do not appear to be put off by her personal objection to gay marriage and opposition to abortion. As the leadership election demonstrated, thousands of party members do not appear to be put off by her personal objection to gay marriage and opposition to abortion. However, those positions are deeply unpopular within the progressive wing of the SNP and she might find it difficult to unite the party and to run a minority government, especially if she were dependent on the Greens for support.Other names being floated as potential replacements for Mr Yousaf are Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth, Culture Secretary Angus Robertson, Health Secretary Neil Gray and Economy Secretary Màiri McAllan.With the Greens apparently standing firm, and the SNP’s leadership’s reluctance to engage with Alba, Mr Yousaf may yet resign rather than endure the humiliation of losing a confidence vote.One source close to the first minister said the end of his time in office appeared to be approaching and that, by sacking the Greens, he had gambled and lost.",

        "content": "For about three months, Adnan El-Bursh reported on the war in Gaza while living in a tent, eating one meal a day, and struggling to keep his wife and five children safe. The BBC Arabic correspondent shares the harrowing moments he faced covering a war that pushed him to his limits.\nWarning: This report contains descriptions and images some readers may find distressing\nOne of the worst moments of the past six months was the night we all slept on the street. I looked at the faces of my wife and children, huddled in the bitter cold in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and felt helpless.\nMy 19-year-old twins, Zakia and Batoul, lay on the pavement alongside my daughter, Yumna, who is 14, my son Mohamed, who is eight and my youngest girl, Razan, aged five, with their mother, Zaynab.\nAs we tried to rest outside the Palestinian Red Crescent Society's headquarters, the sounds of shelling echoed through the night and drones buzzed overhead.\nWe had managed to find an apartment to rent, but the landlord had called earlier that day, saying the Israeli military had warned him the building would be bombed. I was working at the time, but my family grabbed their bags and fled.\nWe met up at the Red Crescent headquarters, which was already overflowing with displaced people.\nMy brother and I sat on cardboard boxes all night, discussing what we should do.\nWe had fled our homes in the town of Jabalia a few days earlier, on 13 October, leaving most of our possessions behind, after the Israeli military told everyone in northern Gaza to move south for safety.\nAnd now we had just escaped being bombed in the area we had been told to move to. It was hard to think straight. I felt angry, humiliated and terrible that I could not provide any protection for my family.\nEventually, my family moved to an apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while I stayed with the BBC team in a tent at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. I visited every few days.\nCommunication was difficult, with internet and phone signals sometimes cut. Once I did not hear from my family for four or five days.\nIn Khan Younis, the BBC team - about seven of us - lived on one meal a day. Even when there was food, sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet.\nDuring this time my friend, Al Jazeera bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, suffered a terrible loss.\nThe house his family had been staying in was hit in an Israeli air strike. His wife, teenage son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed.\nThe Israeli military says it takes \"feasible precautions\" to reduce civilian casualties, and in this case had \"targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area\".\nReporting Gaza: My War\nIn Gaza, Palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis. In this BBC World Service film, we hear the story of BBC Arabic's Reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh who found himself reporting the news, as he was living through it.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK)Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK)\nI watched the footage of my friend, who I have known for 20 years, embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central Gaza. I wished I was there with him.\nThe news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends, relatives and neighbours. My heart ached. I have now lost about 200 people in the war.\nThat day I wept live on air, as I was reporting. In the night, I woke up with tears covering my cheeks. Wael's image never left my mind.\nI have covered conflicts in Gaza for 15 years, but this war stands apart, from the unprecedented attack that triggered it, to the scale of the losses.\nAt 06:15 on 7 October I was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming. I went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards Israel from Gaza.\nWhen we realised Hamas had breached the fence into Israel - in its assault that saw about 1,200 people killed and 250 taken hostage - we knew the response from Israel would be like nothing we had seen before.\nMore than 34,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The risk of injury and death has been ever-present.\nTwo days into the war, I hurried to our local market in Jabalia, to stock up with food. It was busy with others doing the same.\nBut the area was bombed heavily just 10 minutes after I left. The entire place was destroyed, including the large grocery store where I had shopped moments earlier.\nI knew the faces of the shop owners. Many of them were among the dead.\nAmnesty International says at least 69 people were killed in the attack and that it should be investigated as a war crime.\nThe Israeli military has not responded to the BBC's question about this incident.\nThroughout the war it has said its operation is targeting Hamas, which it says operates from civilian locations.\nIt also says \"strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law\".\nBefore the war, Jabalia was a beautiful, tranquil town. I was born there and had been living a simple, contented life with my family, filled with love and plans for the future.\nI had a farm east of the town, where I had planted olive, lemon, and orange trees with my own hands. It was peaceful and I loved to drink tea there after work.\nThe day we decided to flee northern Gaza for Khan Younis - leaving our homes and the BBC office in Gaza City behind - was a pivotal moment in my life.\nWith more than 10 people crammed into one car, my family and I crawled our way south, along a single road, with tens of thousands of other people, on foot and in vehicles, all loaded with belongings.\nThe journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road. Confusion, grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds.\nThe children kept asking me: \"Where are we going? Will we be back tomorrow?\"\nI really wish I had taken our photo album, full of pictures of me as a young child, my parents, and my wife and I when we got engaged. My dad was an Arabic teacher and I also wish I had taken some of his books that I kept after he died.\nLater, I learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed, and my farm burned.\nAfter that terrifying and surreal journey south, and our night outside the Red Crescent headquarters, I continued working from Khan Younis for several weeks. My family were still in Nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally.\nThen, in early December, Israel began telling Gazans to leave parts of Khan Younis and move to other areas, including Rafah, further south.\nThe Israeli military also closed the main road leading north, which connected me and my family. I did not know how I would get to them or where we should go if I did. Rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and there was barely anywhere to stay.\nFor days, I grappled with swirling emotions. News circulated about Israeli forces advancing towards the main roads, apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions.  I was terrified that I - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again.\nFor the first time I felt like I had lost it. I did not even know what day it was. I considered stopping work and returning to my family. If we died, we would die together.\nIn the end, on 11 December, I drove with a colleague along a back road to Nuseirat. When I arrived, my youngest children rushed up to hug me, with Razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight.\nWe managed to move the family to Rafah. The BBC team had also relocated there, continuing to report. There were some awful moments.\nIn late December, I reported as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in Gaza. The IDF said it had taken them from Gaza to Israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them.\nA large lorry drove into the cemetery in the Rafah area. The stench was overwhelming when the container was opened. Men in aprons and masks placed the remains, wrapped in blue plastic, in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground.\nI had never seen a scene like that before. It is hard to describe how horrible it was. \nThen, in January, I was reporting from a hospital in Rafah when several bodies were brought in, including another of Wael Al-Dahdouh's sons, Hamza, his eldest, who was also a journalist working for Al Jazeera.\nWho would tell Wael? It just seemed impossible, after the tragedies he had already faced. I could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to Wael to pass on the news.\nHamza and his colleague, freelance videographer Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in an Israeli air strike on their car, after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area.\nThe Israeli military alleges they were \"members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations\". The families and Al Jazeera reject the claims as false.\nThe IDF says the two were operating drones \"posing an imminent threat to IDF troops\", but a Washington Post investigation \"found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day\".\nMore than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to Reporters Without Borders - the vast majority are known to be Palestinian.\nThe IDF says it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists\". \nIt says it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\", but \"remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks\".\nEventually, the news came that the BBC team's families had permission to leave Gaza. Four weeks later, we too finally left through the Rafah crossing, facilitated by the Egyptian authorities.\nI am writing this in Qatar. But I know that in Jabalia, they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat, while I'm here having meals in a clean hotel. I find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison. \nThe future is a blur. Gaza is my life. I want to return one day, but for now, that seems impossible.",

It's disheartening and it's never-ending.\"\nThe cleaning professional said she thinks social media can put unrealistic expectations on what a clean house looks like: \"Most of those houses have been curated for the shot.\"Young mothers don't need to see that when they are trying to look after children.\"She advised: \"Don't listen to your mother's voice in your head.\"Be clean enough to be healthy - and dirty enough to be happy.\"\nMs Russell said she does not like to use the \"cleanfluencer\" title, saying it \"makes me sound like I should have much better teeth and a nice suntan\".In February 2023, she was forced to stop working after being diagnosed with cancer diagnosis but said her TikTok popularity has helped by providing her with an income while she undergoes treatment.She has also written books on cleaning and offers videos on topics that mean a lot to her, for example, her experience living with cancer.She said: \"I thought by just talking about something, it might be helpful for people.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

The US's Environmental Protection Agency says the chemical is carcinogenic to humans. \n\"Evidence in humans indicates that exposure to ethylene oxide increases the risk of lymphoid cancer and, for females, breast cancer,\" the EPA wrote in 2018.\nThe BBC has contacted MDH and Everest for comment. \nBack in 2019, a few batches of MDH products were recalled in the US due to fears of salmonella contamination.",

That's a full out lie,\" Ms Williams can be heard saying in video of the incident, before appearing to burst into tears. \nIn a statement on Monday, Ms Williams said the prime minister had demanded to speak \"because he was being heckled\" and accused him of behaving like \"a man with power trying to diminish a vulnerable young woman\". \n\"I was happy to just attend as a participant or happy to speak, either way,\" Mr Albanese told Seven News, urging that the controversy should not serve as \"a distraction from what is a very serious issue indeed\". \nAustralia's federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has rejected holding a royal commission into gender-based violence.\nMr Albanese has repeatedly called gender-based violence an epidemic but it's not new: in 2021, marches took place across the country over allegations of sexual misconduct within the parliament and society. \nIn Adelaide, it was estimated around 3,000 people rallied outside the city's parliament building on Saturday. \nProtests have also taken place in Brisbane, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Newcastle over Friday and Saturday, 9News reported.\nRecent killings have put the issue back in the spotlight. \nEarlier this month, a man stabbed six people to death in a Sydney shopping centre. Five of the victims were women and the police are looking at whether they were the target. \nNew South Wales Police Force commissioner Karen Webb said \"the offender focused on women and avoided the men\".\nThe rallies also coincided with the charging of a man with the alleged murder of 30-year-old mother-of-four Erica Hay, who was found dead after a house fire in Perth earlier this month. \nIn all, 27 women have been killed in the first 119 days of 2024, according to data compiled by the campaign group Destroy the Joint.",

Other carmakers such as Xpeng - headquartered in Guangzhou - have been attempting to compete with Tesla by rolling out similar self-driving functions in their cars. \nOn Sunday, Mr Musk described Chinese car manufacturers as \"the most competitive car companies in the world\".\nTesla has taken previously taken steps to reassure Chinese authorities about the rollout of FSD in the country, including establishing a data centre in Shanghai to process data about Chinese consumers in accordance with local laws. \nThe trip comes days after the US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was investigating whether a recall successfully addressed safety concerns relating to Tesla's driver assistance system. \nThe NHTSA said that despite requirements that drivers maintain focus on the road and be prepared to take control at a moment's notice when autonomous driving was enabled, drivers involved in the crashes \"were not sufficiently engaged\". The regulator's analysis was conducted before a recall Tesla said would fix the issue.\nTesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention and that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving on highways.\nMr Musk has promised that Teslas will be able to act as autonomous \"robotaxis\" for years. In 2015, he said Teslas would achieve \"full autonomy\" by 2018. And in 2019, he said the company would have robotaxis operating by the following year. \nThis month, the Tesla chief executive said he would reveal the company's robotaxi in August. \nCritics accuse Mr Musk of consistently hyping up the prospects of full autonomous driving to prop up the company's share price, which has fallen on the back of challenges including falling demand for electric vehicles worldwide and competition from cheaper Chinese manufacturers. Mr Musk denies the accusations.\nTesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to drum up demand.Tesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to drum up demand.\n\"Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand,\" Mr Musk recently said on X, the microblogging platform previously known as Twitter which the billionaire owns. \nTesla recently reported a 13% fall in automotive sales to $17.3bn (£13.7bn) for the first three months of this year.\nOverall sales across Tesla dropped by 9% while its profits fell sharply to $1.13bn compared to $2.51bn for the same period last year.\nSo far in 2024, its share price has collapsed by 32%.",

Five years on, BBC Africa Eye explores whether survivors of attacks are getting justice.\nWarning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting.\nIn the city of Makeni, a three-hour drive east of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, a young mother sits outside her home with her three-year-old daughter. \nAnita, which is not her real name, describes the day in June 2023 when she found her toddler with blood dripping from her nappy. \n\"I worked for this woman, and she gave me an errand that Saturday morning to go to the market,\" she says, explaining that she then left her child with her employer and her 22-year-old son. \n\"He took my child, he said, to buy sweets and biscuits for her. It was a lie.\" \nWhen she got back, she realised her daughter was missing. After searching for her for some time, they were reunited but the 22-year-old mother could see that the toddler was bleeding. She took her to the hospital and after two rounds of stitches, it was confirmed she had been raped. \n\"The nurses began checking the child, and they said: 'Oh my God, what has this man done to this child?' The doctor who was treating my child even cried.\" \nAnita went to the police but the man fled and a year on the police have not been able to find him. \n\"The president created a law so that whoever rapes children, should be arrested and sent to jail,\" she says, angry that nothing appears to have been done.\nShe is referring to a tougher sexual offences law created five years ago after President Maada Bio declared the emergency over rape.\nIt followed protests in December 2018 when hundreds of people wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Hands off our girls\" marched through Freetown.\nNews of another child rape had shocked the nation - a five-year-old girl who was left paralysed from the waist down. It was reported at the time that cases of sexual violence had almost doubled within a year, a third involving children. Sierra Leoneans had had enough.\nThe four-month long state of emergency from February 2019 allowed the president to divert state resources into tackling sexual violence. \nAn updated Sexual Offences Act brought in stricter penalties for sexual assault. \nRape sentences were increased to a minimum of 15 years, or life if it involved a child. A Sexual Offences Model Court to fast-track trials was created in Freetown the following year.\nThere appears to have been some progress - reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence have gone down by almost 17%, from just over 12,000 in 2018 to just over 10,000 in 2023, according to police statistics.\nCreating increased awareness and new structures is one thing, but making sure that people, like Anita's daughter, get justice is another. \nThe Rainbo Initiative is a national charity that works with survivors of sexual violence. It says that in 2022 just 5% of the 2,705 cases it handled made it to the High Court.\nOne of the issues is the resources available to those who are supposed to enforce the law. \nAt the police station in Makeni where Anita reported her daughter's rape, Assnt Supt Abu Bakarr Kanu who leads the Family Support Unit (FSU) says they get around four cases of child sexual assault each week.\nThe big challenge his team faces is a lack of transport to physically go and arrest suspects. \nHe co-ordinates all seven police divisions in the region and between them they do not have a single vehicle. \n\"There are times the suspect is available but because of lack of vehicles you can't reach that suspect to arrest him or her,\" says Assnt Supt Kanu. \n\"Doing the right thing at the right time is a challenge.\" \nLike many in Sierra Leone, he was impressed with the government action that followed the state of emergency. \n\"We have enough… good laws and policy, but the structure and personnel are the challenge for us to holistically address the issues of sexual and gender-based violence in Sierra Leone.\" \nEven if an alleged perpetrator is apprehended, to get them before a judge is an even bigger struggle.\nIn order for the case against a rape suspect to be heard, there is only one person in the country who can sign the documents - the attorney general. It was meant to speed up the process and get the cases straight to the courts, but it has created a different bottle-neck.\n\"Presently it is not possible to have any other law officer or any other counsel to sign an indictment for sexual-related offences,\" says State Counsel Joseph AK Sesay, a lawyer employed by the government. \n\"The 2019 amendment stipulates that it is only the attorney general that can rightly sign an indictment. So that has been posing a challenge when it comes to getting the indictments to courts.\"\nInformation Minister Chernor Bah admits this is not a perfect process but says it is \"a process that we'll continue to improve on\". \nChallenged on the question that many believe little has changed when it comes to getting justice for rape survivors, he acknowledged that \"in some communities people feel that way\".\nBut he rejects the idea that there has been no progress.\n\"I think the systemic reforms that we've put in place are there. The new laws are there. And those steps, I think, have led to the overall feeling that we're not in the deep, dark days of 2019.\" \nFor Anita, back in Makeni, it has been nearly a year since her toddler was raped. \nShe has had no new information from the police, so has resorted to posting the alleged suspect's photo on Facebook. \n\"I want people to help me search for the boy. I'm tormented and I am not happy. What has happened to my child, I don't want it to happen to any other child.\"\nYou can watch the full BBC Africa Eye documentary Behind Closed Doors - Sierra Leone's Gender-Based Violence Epidemic on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.You can watch the full BBC Africa Eye documentary Behind Closed Doors - Sierra Leone's Gender-Based Violence Epidemic on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.",

        "content": "A satellite operated by Japanese company Astroscale has chased down a 15 year-old piece of space junk and taken an up-close image of it.\nThe object is a discarded rocket segment that's about 11m by 4m (36ft by 15ft), with a mass of three tonnes.\nIt's the first time anyone has managed to rendezvous with so big a piece of space debris.\nAstroscale is developing a business that would offer to remove others' redundant hardware from orbit.\nIt won't do it on this occasion; the current mission is all about testing the sensors and software needed for safe proximity operations. But a determined effort to pull a lump of junk out of the sky should occur in the next couple of years, the firm says.\nThe issue of orbital debris and the sustainable use of space is becoming a hot topic right now.\nMillions of items of techno-detritus have accumulated overhead since the start of the space age in 1957 - from flecks of paint to the abandoned upper-stages of rockets, like the one just pictured by Astroscale.\nThis wandering swarm of metal and other materials runs the risk of colliding with, and destroying, the functional satellites we use to communicate and monitor the planet.\nRocket bodies are a particular hazard because of their immense bulk. \nThe one in the new image came from Japan's H-IIA launch vehicle, which lofted a CO2-measuring spacecraft called Gosat, in 2009.\nThe upper-section of the rocket ejected Gosat at an altitude of roughly 600km.\nBut whereas more modern rockets make sure all their parts come back down to Earth soon after a flight, this H-IIA stage stayed up there. And it's far from being alone.\nThe European Space Agency has counted 2,220 rocket bodies still in orbit today.\nAstroscale calls its rendezvous mission Adras-J, or Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan.\nIt's being performed by a smart spacecraft that was launched on 18 February. The satellite has been closing in on the H-IIA body ever since. \nAdras-J used cameras and algorithms to make the final approach. Great care is needed not to bump into the rocket segment, which is slowly turning end over end.\nAstroscale's UK employees built the \"ground segment\" for the mission, which is the system used to communicate with Adras-J. They've also done much of the \"flight dynamics\" work, which is all about precise navigation.\nAround-the-clock operations have been shared by Mission Control in Tokyo and the company's British base at Harwell in Oxfordshire.\nThe plan is to spend the coming weeks taking more imagery and gathering information on the rocket segment, such as the condition of the structure, its spin rate, and spin axis.\nAdras-J will will attempt to fly around the rocket body in the process.\nFuture Astroscale missions will move in and grab hold of their quarry with the aid of robotic arms. \nOn this occasion, Adras-J will limit itself to an experiment in which it will try to slow the tumbling rate of the rocket stage. \nThe activity will involve firing thrusters at the body in a direction opposite to its spin motion. The pressure of the thrusters' plume ought to decelerate the rotation rate.\nA number of companies around the world are developing technologies similar to Astroscale. \nExperts say that to prevent a cascade of collisions in orbit, it's imperative space-faring nations start removing several large pieces of junk every year.",

On a previous flight, Patricia and her daughter were waiting inside the plane after other passengers had left, as airport staff had not arranged a wheelchair for her.She says having her real age acknowledged would also be beneficial for Kris.“I would like them to fix the computer as my poor daughter had to carry all our luggage and apparel almost a mile from one gate to the other,” she said.\nPatricia travelled solo until she was 97, but has been reliant on help from her family since then.“I have some trouble with my eyesight now so I wouldn’t want to do it on my own,” she said.But she is adamant the IT problems will not put her off flying, and says she is looking forward to her next flight in the autumn.By then she will be 102 - and perhaps by then the airline computers will have caught on to her real age.",

        "content": "A British man seriously injured in a shark attack in Tobago is \"aware of what is happening\" and \"able to communicate\", his wife has said.\nPeter Smith, 64, was on the Caribbean island with wife Jo and friends when he was attacked in Courland Bay on Friday morning.\nTwo of the friends stayed in the water to \"battle the shark\", Mrs Smith said.\nHer husband is in intensive care in the island's Scarborough General Hospital, where he is in a stable condition.\n\"Peter has suffered damage to his left arm and leg, puncture wounds to the abdomen and injuries to his right hand, the full extent of which are still being evaluated,\" said Mrs Smith, of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. \nHospital medics are now deciding on \"the future course of treatment\", she added.\nThe Tobago House of Assembly said the incident involved a bull shark estimated to be eight to 10 ft (2.4m to 3m) long and 2ft (60cm) wide. \nIts chief secretary Farley Augustine had said on Saturday that Mr Smith had had some fingers reattached after the attack, with \"significant wounds\" to one of his legs that would require \"extensive work\".  \n\"As of 09:00 local time today, Peter is aware of what is happening and is able to communicate a little, although he is still under strong medication,\" his wife said. \nShe thanked \"all those that assisted at the scene, and especially the two friends that remained in the water to battle the shark\". \nMrs Smith also thanked \"the wonderfully kind people of Tobago for all their help and support\". \nEyewitness Orion Jakerov, water sports manager at the nearby Starfish resort, has said other people in the water were \"physically trying to fight off the shark\".\nHe told the local broadcaster TTT Live: \"I don't think they saw it. They were about waist height in the water so they weren't out of their depth. He told the local broadcaster TTT Live: \"I don't think they saw it. They were about waist height in the water so they weren't out of their depth. \n\"I think their backs were turned and they were just kind of lounging around. Nobody saw the shark coming.\" \nAuthorities closed seven beaches and all coastal areas between the town of Plymouth on the island's northern coast and Store Bay on its western tip, a stretch of around seven miles (11.3km), in the wake of the attack. \nDrones were being used to carry out surveillance of the area, and anyone operating a boat was urged to exercise caution.  \nBull sharks are known to be aggressive and are most often found in shallow waters along tropical coastlines, making them - along with great white and tiger sharks - among the species most likely to come into contact with, and attack, humans. \nA $10,000 (£8,010) bounty previously offered to anyone who could capture the shark and move it away from the beaches was retracted, Mr Augustine said on Saturday.\nTobago, the smaller of the two islands of Trinidad and Tobago, is located in the southern Caribbean, around 74 miles (119km) off the coast of South America.

        "content": "At least five people, including a four-month-old baby, have been killed after dozens of tornadoes ripped through the central US causing serious damage. \nTens of thousands of residents were left without power following separate storms that began on Friday. \nFour of the deaths happened in Oklahoma, where a state of emergency has been declared in a dozen counties.  \nA fifth person died from their injuries in Iowa after a separate storm system hit the Midwest, local media reported.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said a preliminary investigation had confirmed some of Saturday's tornadoes had gusts of above 136 miles (218km) an hour.\nThe storms - which swept from Texas to Missouri - also saw up to seven inches (18cm) of rain fall in some places within hours, the AFP news agency reported. \nThe town of Sulphur, in eastern Oklahoma, was hit particularly hard. Video of the aftermath showed flattened homes and overturned vehicles. \nAccording to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, around 100 injuries were reported.\nThe towns of Holdenville and Marietta were also badly damaged.\nThe speaker of the Oklahoma state House of Representatives, Charles McCall, insisted that the affected areas would recover. \n\"We will rise, we'll clean up, we'll rebuild and we'll move forward,\" he told a news conference in Sulphur on Sunday. \nThe state's Governor, Kevin Stitt, also visited the town and said the damage there was the worst he had seen in his six years in office. \n\"You just can't believe the destruction,\" he said. \n\"It seems like every business downtown has been destroyed.\"\nThe White House said US President Joe Biden had spoken with Mr Stitt and offered the federal government's full support. \nIt comes after a separate weather system brought more than 70 tornadoes to the Midwestern states of Nebraska and Iowa on Friday. \nMost happened around the city of Omaha, where one resident described his ordeal.\n\"Saw this big tornado coming and just had to cover with the kids and wife as fast as we could,\" Brent Richardson told the Associated Press.\n\"Loudest freight train you've ever heard in your life coming right through your house.\"\n\"Utter destruction, just chaos. A neighbourhood that's trying to band together to help people out and you have some people trapped in houses that we're trying to get out and there's houses that aren't standing any more.\"\nNebraska's governor issued emergency declarations for three counties on Sunday, making them also eligible for extra funding towards rescue and recovery operations. \nFurther severe weather has been forecast. \n\"The threat of tornadoes appears to be lower, but instances of damaging winds and hail are still expected, especially across north-eastern Texas, northern Louisiana, Arkansas and southern Missouri,\" meteorologist Brandon Buckingham from the commercial forecaster AccuWeather reported. \nHave you been affected by a tornado in your area?

        "content": "Sam Attar reckons he left part of his soul in Gaza. It was the part of him that saw suffering and could not turn away. The part which now cannot forget. \nYou can be on the shores of Lake Michigan on an overcast spring day, the wind whipping up waves on the green water. And at the very same time you can be back there, in the heat and the dying.\nIt's been three weeks since he came home to Chicago but it might as well have been yesterday. The faces of that other world are with him: Jenna, the traumatised little girl wasting away, spectral pale on a hospital bed, while her mother shows Sam a phone video of the child's last birthday. Happy days before the disaster. \nWarning: This article contains details and images some readers may find disturbing.\nAnother mother whose 10-year-old son had just died. \n\"The mom just told me with just a blank numb stare on her face that he had just died five minutes prior. The staff had been trying to cover up his body with blankets but she just refused to let them. She wanted to spend more time with him. She was grieving, she was sobbing, and stayed that way for about a good 20 minutes, she just didn't want to  leave his side.\"\nThen there was the man in his 50s, forgotten in a room, having had both legs amputated. \n\"He had lost his kids, his grandkids, his home,\" Sam recalls, \"and he's alone in the corner of this dark hospital, maggots going out of his wounds and he was screaming: 'The worms are eating me alive please help me.' That was just one just one out of… I don't know, I just I stopped counting. But those are the people I still think of because they're still there.\"\nSam is a sensitive, thoughtful man in his 40s, the son of two doctors, who was born and raised in Chicago and who works as a surgeon at Northwestern hospital in the city. While in Gaza he kept video diaries and filmed his experiences.\nFor two weeks in March and April - on behalf of the NGO Palestinian American Bridge - he worked in Gaza hospitals that were desperately short of everything except badly-wounded patients. On the day he entered Gaza this time around he was immediately confronted with the hunger crisis.\n\"We were just swarmed by people banging on the cars, some people trying to jump on the cars. The drivers… they just got it. They don't stop because if they stopped then people jump on the cars. They're not trying to harm us. They're just begging for food. They're starving.\"\nSam recounts his experiences calmly, as you might expect of a man trained to put patients at ease.  Every day there was the relentless pressure of carrying out triage, deciding who could be saved, who was beyond hope. Patients lying on hospital floors surrounded by blood and discarded bandages, the air filled with the cries of pain and of grieving relatives. \nThere is no erasing such horrors. Even if you are a highly trained doctor with past experience of war zones like Ukraine, Syria and Iraq. \n\"I still think of all the patients I took care of,\" he says, \"all the doctors that are still there. There's a little bit of guilt and shame at leaving because there's so much that needs to be done. The needs are overwhelming. And you walk away from people that are still there and still suffering.\"\nThe last trip - his third into Gaza since the war began - saw him join the first team of international medics to be embedded in a hospital in northern Gaza where malnutrition is at its most acute. \nThe mission was organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which has warned of looming famine. Some 30% of children below the age of two are reported to be acutely malnourished, and 70% of the population in northern Gaza is facing what the UN calls \"catastrophic hunger.\" \nLast month the UN Human Rights chief, Volker Turk, accused Israel of a potential war crime because of the food crisis in Gaza. Last month the UN Human Rights chief, Volker Turk, accused Israel of a potential war crime because of the food crisis in Gaza. \n\"The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war,\" he said.  \nIsrael denies this and has blamed the UN and aid agencies for any slow or inadequate delivery of aid. \nThe Israeli government said UN calculations on hunger were based on \"multiple factual and methodological flaws, some of them serious.\" The government has said that it had tracked media reports that food markets in Gaza, including the north, had plentiful supplies. \n\"We outright reject any allegations according to which Israel is purposefully starving the civilian population in Gaza,\" said a statement from COGAT - Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. \nSam Attar remembers the 32-year-old woman admitted suffering from severe malnutrition, with her son, and her mother and father in the room with her. \nShe underwent CPR - attempts to resuscitate the heart - but could not be saved. \n\"I had to call it,\" Sam says. The young mother lay on a bench, her left arm dangling towards the floor, eyes gazing upward in the moment of death. Across the room a nurse comforted her crying mother. \nThere was the little girl, Jenna Ayyad, aged seven, \"just skeleton and bone\" whose mother hoped to get to the south where better medical facilities were available. \nJenna was traumatised by the war and looked to be extremely malnourished. She suffers from cystic fibrosis, which makes digestion more difficult. Her condition has been exacerbated by the conditions of the war and she is also suffering from trauma. In footage taken by a BBC cameraman Jenna seems lost and now only speaks to her mother.\n\"What can I do? She can't be treated,\" said Nisma Ayyad. \"Her mental state is very difficult. She doesn't talk at all whenever anyone talks to her. Her situation is bad, and as a mom, I can't do anything.\"\nDr Attar said that as his team packed up to return to southern Gaza, Jenna's mother approached him.\n\"Jenna's mom came to me and was saying, 'I thought we were coming with you… what's happening? Why are you going and we're staying?\" \nSam had to explain that the convoy south was only approved for the delivery of fuel and food and not for carrying patients.  \nBut before leaving Sam and his colleagues filled in the necessary papers to have Jenna transferred. It would take days but they would make sure the paperwork reached the right offices.  When Sam went to speak with Jenna's mother, other mums noticed. \n\"The problem is it's open, shared rooms, [with] maybe 10 patients in one room. So when all the other moms saw me talking to her, they all swarmed me.\"\nJenna was transferred and is now being treated at the International Medical Corps hospital near Rafah.\nAccording to UN estimates last month the majority of those killed in the war have been women and children: 13,000 children, 9,000 women.  \nThe war is now in its seventh month. Negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of hostages are stalled. Every day and night the wounded and the malnourished arrive at the few functioning hospitals that are left. The WHO says that only 10 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still functioning. \nTraveling in Gaza can be very dangerous for aid workers. Witness the deaths of seven aid workers, including three Britons, when the Israeli military attacked their convoy with missile strikes on 1 April. \nSam describes queuing for hours at Israeli checkpoints. \"We often wait one to four hours depending on how long it takes for the Israelis to approve the passage because they are conducting military operations.\"\nThe US doctor wants to see a concerted push to get more aid into the north.\n\"The north just needs more access, it needs more food, more fuel, more water, the roads need to be opened… And there are so many patients that need to be evacuated from the north to the south and the problem is the south is also busy. I mean, the hospitals here are exploding.\"\nHe will go back. Soon he hopes. There are bonds of friendship which call out to him. \nThe paramedic Nabil who Sam saw every day, bringing in the wounded for treatment, until he himself became a victim who had to be pulled from the rubble by his colleagues. He is alive but will not be able to leave Gaza. \nThe doctor whose daughter was killed but who found the generosity to comfort a mother whose toddler son was suffering from a brain injury caused by bomb shrapnel. \nAnd there are the patients and their families who see in the doctors, nurses and paramedics not just the possibility of practical help but the steady light of human decency in a place of terror and degradation. \nThese are Sam Attar's people. All of them. \nWith additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Annie Duncanson, Haneen Abdeen, Nik Millard",

        "content": "It has been almost three months since King Charles was diagnosed with an unspecified type of cancer. \nAt the time the monarch, 75, said he remained \"wholly positive\" about his treatment and looked forward to returning to public duties as soon as possible. \nAnd although he postponed his public-facing duties, he continued with his constitutional work as head of state, including doing paperwork and private meetings. \nHe is now \"greatly encouraged\" to be resuming some public duties while continuing treatment for cancer. \nBuckingham Palace's tone is positive.\nIt says the King's medical team is \"very encouraged\" about his continued recovery and that his doctors have been \"sufficiently pleased\" with progress made so far. \nSome of his engagements will be adapted, if needed, \"to minimise any risks to His Majesty's continued recovery\". \nFor example, he will not take on a full summer programme.\nThe King, has generally led a fit and active life, with few reported medical problems.\nHis cancer was discovered incidentally during a procedure for a benign (non-cancerous) prostate enlargement.  \nAs soon as the cancer was spotted he quickly started a course of treatment. \nExperts know that catching and treating cancer early gives the best chance of a good recovery. \nThe Palace says his \"treatment programme\" will continue and it is too early to say how long that might last. \nIt has not given any details about the type of treatment the King is having.\nCancer treatments can come in many different forms.\nSome are more intensive - requiring lots of hospital trips - and have more side effects than others. Other ones can be given at home.\nThere are many different ways of tackling cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to remove or destroy cancerous cells. \nOften a combination of different approaches is used. \nFollow-up care can be very important too - including scans and regular checks. \nSome people may receive cancer treatment for weeks, months or years.  \nThis might be to prevent cancer from returning, put cancer into remission or help control the progression of cancer, for example.\nSome rounds of treatment can dampen the immune system for a while - meaning the risk of infections can be increased. \nBuckingham Palace says the King's diary will be \"carefully calibrated\" as his recovery continues. \nHis medical team will be in close consultation and make sure he gets all the treatment he needs. They won't want any of his duties to hinder that progress and his engagements can be adapted, if necessary. \nCancer, and the treatments given to stop it, can cause extreme tiredness or fatigue. And that can vary throughout the day, with each day being different. \nThe palace has not disclosed details about the type of cancer the King has but has said it is not prostate cancer. \nLike any patient, medical details are private. \nBuckingham Palace says: \"His Majesty is greatly encouraged to be resuming some public-facing duties and very grateful to his medical team for their continued care and expertise.\"\nThe King joins the legions of people around the world living with cancer. One in two people in the UK develop some kind of cancer during their lifetime.\nIt's a diagnosis that impacts not just your health but your social, family and working life too. \nAfter taking some time off, His Majesty will shortly return to public-facing duties. \nNotably, his first visit next week will be to a cancer treatment centre. \nHe now understands first-hand what living with cancer can entail, although the journey is different for each individual affected. \nHis may not be the typical story, but he says he is deeply grateful for the kindness and good wishes he has received since going public about it.\nThere is practical support and information out there for people trying to navigate their way, juggling cancer treatment alongside all the daily responsibilities of life, like paying the bills.\nEmotional support is vital too. You may want to talk to someone you know well - a partner or friend - or perhaps someone you do not know so well, like your doctor or a specialist nurse. Some organisations such as Mind and MacMillan can offer this type of support too. Emotional support is vital too.

        "content": "The Portuguese government has said it has no plans to pay reparations for the country's role in transatlantic slavery and colonialism.\nThe previously dormant debate about the country's role in the slave trade and other colonial-era abuses roared back into life last week after its President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested it should make amends for such \"crimes\".\nBut the right-of-centre government - dominated by a party that Mr de Sousa once led - dismissed the idea, while the far-right Chega party is to seek a vote in parliament condemning the president and his comments, which it said \"undoubtedly represent a betrayal of the Portuguese people and its History\". \nIt was in a wide-ranging conversation with foreign correspondents that the president was asked whether reparations were due for the slave trade, during which Portuguese ships took millions of people from Africa, mainly to Brazil, where they were forced to work on plantations. \nIn his response, he did not mention slavery, but said Portugal should take \"full responsibility\" for its past, citing massacres and looting as abuses for which it could \"pay the costs\".\nBrazil's Minister of Racial Equality, Anielle Franco, demanded \"concrete actions\" to match these words.\nHowever, on 25 April, at celebrations in Lisbon to mark the 50th anniversary of the coup that ended decades of dictatorship, Mr de Sousa did not return to the subject at an event attended by presidents of the former colonies whose path to independence was eased by the 1974 Revolution. In their own speeches, they described the date as a symbol of freedom; none mentioned reparations.\nThe government, meanwhile, only issued its statement on Saturday, after the president had expanded on his earlier comments by arguing that development aid and debt forgiveness could help make amends for the colonial past. \nPortugal, he said, had an \"obligation\" to \"lead\" on this, warning it to avoid the fate of \"other countries that... have lost the capacity for dialogue and understanding with their former colonies\".\nIn a terse statement, the government said it \"follows the same line\" as its predecessors on reparations: \"There was and is no process or programme of specific actions for this purpose.\"\nIn fact, the minister of culture in the previous, Socialist government had been looking into returning looted items. And the current minister, among whose past roles were director of a national museum whose collection includes items from former colonies, has backed the idea in the past. \nAnti-racist groups and far-left parties that have long campaigned on these issues have returned to the fray in recent days. But Portugal's conservative president is making the running. \nAs he reminded foreign correspondents last week, under the dictatorship his father was governor of Mozambique and then the last minister for the colonies, so Mr de Sousa is well placed to discredit voices on the right who say that colonialism was not so bad, after all.",

        "content": "When Varsha Sahu accidentally inhaled the screw of her nose pin two months ago, she wasn't too concerned.\nShe thought the pin had gone into her stomach and would naturally pass through her digestive system.\nBut the metal object got lodged in her lung and caused her weeks of discomfort and shortness of breath until finally it was removed by doctors. \nLike most married Hindu women in India, 35-year-old Varsha had been wearing a nose pin since her wedding \"16-17 years back\" as it's considered a symbol of marital status.\n\"I didn't know that the screw had come loose,\" she told the BBC on the phone from her home in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. \n\"I was just chatting and I took a deep breath and I inhaled it. I had no idea it went into my airway. I thought it had gone into my stomach,\" the mother of two teenaged boys added.\nDr Debraj Jash, a pulmonologist at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, who removed the pin from Varsha's lung last month, described her case as \"extremely rare\" - Indian media have reported only two cases in the past decade. \n\"Sometimes we get cases where dry fruits or betel nuts have gone into people's lungs, but most such cases involve young children or elderly people above 80. A woman patient in her 30s is an exception.\"\nVarsha's story came to light when - a month after inhaling the screw - she went to a doctor complaining of a persistent cough and shortness of breath and pneumonia. She initially blamed the breathing difficulties on an earlier injury to her nose. \nWhen medicines didn't help, she consulted a pulmonologist. A CT scan detected the object in her lung and a subsequent chest X-ray showed what it was.\nThe pulmonologist sent a fibreoptic bronchoscope - a tiny camera with forceps - down her airway. But it couldn't grasp the \"sharp shining object\" and failed to pull it out. She then referred the patient to Dr Jash.\n\"We had to counsel the patient first. She was worried about undergoing a second procedure so soon after the first one, but we explained to her that the human body is designed in such a way that there's no place in it for a foreign object,\" he said. \n\"We told her there was no way her body was going to accept it and that if left untreated, her pneumonia would keep getting worse,\" he added. \nDr Jash says he also told her that they may even have to perform an invasive surgery which would involve hiving off a part of her lung. But as it could potentially have long-term complications, he decided to give the fibreoptic bronchoscope another try.\n\"It is extremely difficult to pull out a sharp object with a regular flexible bronchoscope. The object had been in her lung for more than two weeks and tissues had already grown around it. \n\"We had to be very careful because if during extraction, the screw came in contact with the airway - which is very narrow - it could cause injury and lead to a bleeding which could cause a catastrophe.\"\nBut the procedure, which lasted 30 minutes, was successful and Varsha was discharged after four days in the hospital.\n\"She's been back for follow-ups and she's now perfectly fine,\" Dr Jash said.\nVarsha laughs when I ask her if she's gone back to wearing nose pins again.\n\"No way. I could never imagine that something like this could happen, but it did. I do not want a repeat of it.\"",

Shortly after, students erected another protest camp at Yale University in Connecticut. \nAt Northeastern University in Boston, over 100 protesters were arrested for trespassing on Saturday by the Massachusetts State Police after refusing to clear their tents from college grounds, according to a police statement. The camp was cleared by police. \nNortheastern University wrote on X that \"demonstrations had been infiltrated by professional organisers\" with no connection to the university. Antisemitic slurs had been heard, it added, saying: \"We cannot tolerate this kind of hate on campus.\" Protest leaders strongly rejected the allegations. \nAt the University of South California, pro-Palestinian demonstrators returned to campus days after police were called to clear a protest at the university's Alumni Park. The protest was reportedly mostly peaceful but the university administration reported \"vandalism\" to campus property after Saturday's protest. \nThe university said the campus had been vandalised \"by individuals who are part of the group that has continued to illegally camp on our campus\", adding that a statue and fountain had been damaged. The campus would be temporarily closed to non-residents, the university said.\nTwenty-three people were arrested at Indiana University on Saturday.\nOther campuses, including Columbia and Emory University in Georgia, were reportedly quieter Saturday. \nThe protests were sparked by anger at Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe Israeli military launched the offensive after about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, mostly civilians, were killed and 253 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near Gaza on 7 October last year.",

The university says it has beaten its own record for the world's largest polymer 3D printer - with the new printer four times bigger than the previous machine.The Factory of the Future 1.0 (FoF 1.0) can print objects 96ft (29m) long - approximately the length of a blue whale.But experts say, despite the breakthrough, most of us will continue to live in homes made of bricks and mortar.\nLarge 3D printers, such as that unveiled in Maine, are more like to be used to make parts of houses rather than full homes, says Dr Eujin Pei, who is an expert in additive manufacturing at Brunel University.He says they can be used for historical restoration, \"not to print a house, but sometimes to print decorative parts, or sometimes to restore some parts.\"They may become useful after natural disasters to manufacture parts of destroyed buildings, he told the BBC.The University of Maine says it hopes the printer can be used to make affordable housing, as well as bridges, boats and wind turbines.It can print up to 500lbs (227kg) of material per hour.While 3D printers often print using plastic, the university hopes to include more sustainable materials and prioritise recycled polymers. Maine is also home to large forests - and the hope is to use residual wood from sawmills as material to feed into the printer.\"The downside is that those kind of materials are not so durable,\" says Dr Pei.Wood is \"not so robust, but it's more environmentally friendly,\" he says.The 3D printing process saves on time and waste by only using the materials needed, but there are still some environmental impacts.\"Sometimes the materials being used are not fully being able to be recycled because of contamination\" in the production process, Dr Pei adds.However, as products are designed on a computer first, their energy efficiency can be calculated beforehand - and they can be printed in a way which takes less time.\"There are definitely cost savings with respect to energy efficiency [and] resource efficiency,\" says Dr Pei.\nPartly funded by the US military, the giant printer in Maine uses \"sensors, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence\" to help manufacture large products, said Habib Dagher, who is head of the university's Advanced Structures and Composites Center. FoF 1.0's record-breaking predecessor built a bungalow as a prototype, but the hope is to help solve Maine's housing shortage with the new FoF 1.0.FoF 1.0's record-breaking predecessor built a bungalow as a prototype, but the hope is to help solve Maine's housing shortage with the new FoF 1.0.It also used wood as a material which was fed into the manufacturing process.The university says the two printers can work together in manufacturing the same object too.\nIt has long been hoped that 3D printing will transform manufacturing, both large and small scale.It has been used in a wide range of fields, from space rockets to human cells to puppets.It has been used in a wide range of fields, from space rockets to human cellspuppets.But it also has a dark side - with criminals using the technology to manufacture weapons.Last year, in what was thought to be the first case of its kind in the UK, two men were jailed for making sub-machine guns using a 3D printer.Last year, in what was thought to be the first case of its kind in the UK, two men were jailed for making sub-machine guns using a 3D printer.Later in 2023, a man in Birmingham was sentenced to five years in prison for making 3D-printed assault rifles.Later in 2023, a man in Birmingham was sentenced to five years in prison for making 3D-printed assault rifles.",

Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently.\nThese recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight.Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently.More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site.It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV.Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages.But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen.\"The internet is not exactly getting more stable,\" he told the BBC.To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself.Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong.\"Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,\" Mr Smith said. \"I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech companies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking things.\"\nThe other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down.The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down.Even severe weather, such as heatwaves, storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely.Even severe weather, such as heatwaves, storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely.\"There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can see problems,\" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI.Another issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and infrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade.That has enabled those firms to do more \"faster than they ever could before\", Mr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at the cloud service provider can \"cascade across a lot of the platforms, technologies and companies we use today\".Glitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to downtime for thousands of customers.Even those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly and Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services. The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021.The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021.'It had just vanished' - the shock when tech fails\nSudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends.Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says.But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them.\"Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,\" he says.IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes.IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes.More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it.Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called \"thundering herds\" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site.Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called \"thundering herds\" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site.\nUnderpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies \"on a fabric of really old technology\", says Mr Kirkman.He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021.He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021.Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet.And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses.And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses\nMr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms.It highlights what he says some might consider \"technical debt\" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet.These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them.\"What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,\" says Mr Smith.\"I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,\" he adds.",

        "content": "Protests against the war in Gaza are now roiling dozens of college campuses across the US, many of them storied and highly respected universities. Why are students pitching tents and refusing to leave? And what, specifically, do they want to achieve?\nTensions quickly flared at American universities after the 7 October attack by Hamas that led to the deaths of around 1,200 people in Israel, and to a retaliatory assault that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.\nBut over the past two weeks, those tensions have boiled over into an uprising that joins the ranks of Occupy Wall Street and the 1980s anti-apartheid movement and evokes memories of the protests against the Vietnam War.\nAs historical comparisons abound, college administrators, law enforcement and politicians are grappling with how to respond to rein in a nationwide revolt in a new era dominated by social media and 24-hour news.\nSince October, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, hunger strikes, and most recently, encampments against the war.\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties.They are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel. Divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties.\nStudent activists say that companies doing business in or with the nation of Israel are complicit in its ongoing war on Gaza - and so are the colleges that invest in those companies.\nUniversity endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments. They own shares of large companies from Amazon to Microsoft, and put money into private equity, hedge funds and index funds.\nTo understand what is happening now, look back to last December, when the heads of Ivy Leagues testified before Congress about antisemitism on campus. What was seen as waffling put those officials in hot water, and led to the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania resigning.\nLast week, Columbia president Nemat Shafik - who has faced criticism over her own handling of campus divisions about the war - was in the Capitol Hill hot seat, and staked out a much tougher stance on antisemitism than her counterparts had done.\nWhile she was traveling to Washington and testifying, hundreds of students pitched tents to camp in the centre of the New York City campus, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on university leaders to divest from Israel.\nBy the encampment's second day, the city's police department was called in to break up and clear the protest. More than 100 students were arrested for trespassing, with many suspended and now potentially facing criminal charges.\nThe raid appeared to anger and embolden protesters, with student activists banding together once again on campus, organising through social media.\nWith classes due to end next month and final exams around the corner, these Occupy-style tactics prompted the school to shut down all in-person classes on Monday and urge faculty and staff to work remotely. The protest is ongoing.\nThe escalating crisis at Columbia has now inspired similar encampments at private and public universities in at least 16 states and Washington, DC. They are:\nOn Thursday, in response to its own on-campus protests, the University of Southern California announced it had cancelled its main-stage graduation ceremony for students.\nOfficials said they could no longer host the 10 May event, where some 65,000 students and their guests were expected, citing new safety measures that would be required.\nThey added that the school had received several threats to disrupt the ceremony.\nAsna Tabassum, a Muslim student of South Asian descent chosen by the school as its valedictorian, or highest-performing graduate, had earlier been barred from delivering the event's traditional valedictory speech. The school also cited safety concerns.\nPro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.Pro-Palestinian campus groups have for years called on their institutions to support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, as a means of pushing back against Israel.\nNo US university has ever committed to the BDS framework, although some have cut specific financial ties in the past.\nAs a practical matter, endowment portfolios are often managed by asset managers rather than the universities themselves, and closely protect information about their positions in the stock market. But student activists have argued for greater transparency about these funds, even if they do not make active or direct investments to Israel.\nAnd while divestment would have a negligible impact, if any, on the war in Gaza, protesters say it would shed light on those who profit from war and help build awareness of their issue, similar to how divestment from fossil fuel companies has galvanised climate activism.\nOrganisers also appear to be taking some inspiration from the 1980s, when college students targeted companies doing business with apartheid South Africa and ultimately forced more than 150 schools to divest from the country.\nThe events of the past fortnight have so far not achieved such success.",

It sank with the loss of more than 1,500 lives.The disaster is one of the most infamous in maritime history, inspiring books, plays, songs and Hollywood films.\nThe watch and the brown leather violin bag belonged to two people who became enshrined in Titanic folklore.Mr Astor, 47, went down with the ship, after putting his young wife Madeleine into a lifeboat and smoking a last cigarette.While Wallace Hartley, from Colne in Lancashire, and his eight-piece band famously \"played on\" to calm passengers as the disaster unfolded around them.Both items were retrieved when the bodies of their owners were recovered from the water.\"Unlike many timepieces from the Titanic, which are frozen in time on the fateful night, the watch was restored and worn by Mr Astor's son, Vincent,\" said David Beddard, chairman of the British Titanic Society.\"To be able to see J.J. Astor's watch, knowing it was in his pocket as he put his young, pregnant bride in a lifeboat and stepped back, knowing he wasn't going to survive, is remarkable,\" he added.\nMr Hartley went down with the ship, but not before he put his violin back in its leather valise, which he strapped to himself, possibly for buoyancy.Days after the sinking, Mr Hartley's body was recovered with the bag still attached to him.\"The valise survived quite well, although water-damaged,\" said Mr Beddard. \"Many tests were carried out over the course of about five or six years before the violin and case were validated.\"The recovery of items from victims' bodies is always a contentious issue when it comes to collecting.\"However, we're very lucky with the Titanic community that even when items such as these are purchased by individuals, be they millionaires or just ordinary people, they seem to be very generous and they lease or loan these artefacts to go on display.\"\nMr Aldridge, managing director at Henry Aldridge & Son in Devizes, said: \"You've got over 2,200 people on that ship, so you have over 2,200 subplots and 2,200 chapters to the story. \"Each one of those people had an individual tale to tell.\"We are fascinated in her because of who was on board. \"You could argue that Titanic is the most famous ship that's ever sailed.\"\nThe violin, considered to be the \"rarest and most iconic piece\" of Titanic memorabilia, according to Mr Aldridge, was auctioned separately in 2013 and sold for a then record price of £900,000.The bag and watch were auctioned alongside a rare order of service for Mr Hartley's funeral that was held on 18 May 1912 in Colne, Lancashire.Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "content": "The Labour Party has said it expects to renationalise most passenger rail services in England within five years, if it is elected.But what will this mean for passengers, and when could it come into effect?\nShadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said she could not say that Labour would lower fares, but they would simplify them.\"We'll make them more accessible, more transparent and more trustworthy for passengers, \" she said.Ms Haigh also said Labour would deliver a \"best fare guarantee\", so people could be sure they are always paying the lowest fare for their journey.Labour pledges to renationalise most rail services within five yearsHowever, railway specialist Tony Miles - who has covered the industry for over 40 years -  said any savings were likely to be minimal because the private operators' profit margins are already so small, at an average of 12p for each passenger journey.He argued this would mean Labour would only be able to pass on very small savings per journey.\nFrom just after the Second World War until the 1990s the UK rail system was fully nationalised, with the government owning the rail networks and all of the trains.The industry was privatised in the 1990s, with services run by a variety of train operating companies.At the moment the infrastructure is managed by Network Rail, while passenger train services are run by individual operators.However, there are degrees of nationalisation. During the pandemic, the government in effect took control of the railway, with most train companies in England moving onto contracts where they get a fixed fee to run services, and the taxpayer carries the financial risk.The situation is different in Scotland and Wales, where passenger services are already run by the devolved governments. In Northern Ireland, the system is fully nationalised.Under Labour's plans, a new arm's-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), would take over the service contracts currently held by private firms in England as they expire in the future.However, GBR would continue to lease rolling stock from private firms, and there is no plan to nationalise rail freight companies.Whether it will make the trains run better \"comes down to how they’re going to fund things\", says Peter Simmons, deputy editor at International Railway Journal.\"The issue under the old days of nationalisation was that the government of the day wasn’t prepared to fund things in a way that allowed major construction projects to move forward.”\nLuxembourg operates a fully state-run system where all train journeys are free, and train tickets in other European countries with more state control than the UK can be much cheaper.However, those networks also receive lots of government investment, which can mean higher taxes.Mr Miles argues the UK’s franchising system, whereby the government owns the network through National Rail and hands out operator contracts to private companies, was the “envy of Europe” before Covid hit.He said passenger numbers have increased as a result of the franchise system, but added that the contracts written during Covid were done so “in a rush” and are “too generous”.He pointed to Transport for London and the Manchester bus service as examples of where a state run franchising system to private contractors can work.Mr Simmons says trains in the UK are \"not as bad as people think\".\"Sometimes the perception is that everywhere else is better, and that’s very much not true.”However, he said other countries were “powering ahead” with long-term planning for major projects.\nA Labour government could wait until the current franchise contracts run out and take them on itself, as the government did during Covid. There would not necessarily be any upfront costs to do this.However, doing so would also mean taking on the railway operators debts, leases, and liabilities, such as their pension fund pots and the lease contracts for the trains.If Labour wanted to invest in the railway network or buy back the trains, that would cost money.Labour says its plans would save the taxpayer £2.2bn a year, but Louise Haigh said she had no guarantee that all this money would be reinvested in the railways.Andy Bagnall, the chief executive of Rail Partners, which represents private operators on the rail network, says nationalisation will lead to higher costs in the long run.He says that without the commercial focus of private firms, \"costs would creep up over time, revenue growth will be slower and the taxpayer is the one that loses out\".\nIf Labour were to win the general election - expected later this year - then \"it could happen very quickly,\" says Mr Simmons, given the plan is to transfer train networks to public ownership as the current operator contracts begin to run out.Some train operators are already under public control after being taken into the government’s Operator of Last Resort.Many train operators' franchises come up for renewal in the next few years, but most contain some form of break clause, which means the government could take control earlier.For example, Avanti West Coast's contract was renewed in October last year and runs for a maximum of nine years, which would take it to 2032 and beyond the next parliament.However, the contract has a \"core term\" of three years, after which the government can terminate it at three months' notice.\nUK private operators' contract expiry dates*South Western - May 2025Essex Thameside (c2c) - July 2025East Anglia - September 2026West Midlands - September 2026Chiltern - December 2027Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern - April 2028Great Western - June 2028East Midlands - October 2030Cross Country (Arriva) - October 2031West Coast - October 2032*Does not include break or extension clausesUK public operatorsCaledonian SleeperEast Coast (LNER)NI RailwaysNorthernScotRailSouth EasternTransPennine ExpressTransport for WalesSource: Rail Partners",

The CEO of Nats, formerly National Air Traffic Services, Martin Rolfe, insisted the ability to problem solve remotely when called upon was \"a bonus\".There was air traffic chaos last August Bank Holiday Monday when flights ground to a halt in and out of the UK because of an IT systems failure. It took an on-call senior engineer took more than 90 minutes to reach the office after he was unable to fix the issue at home.  \nThe major outage disrupted flight plans for almost 750,000 passengers last summer.Low-cost airline Ryanair levied particularly strong criticism at Nats in the aftermath of the August incident. Its boss Michael O'Leary accused engineers of \"sitting at home in their pyjamas\".However, speaking to the Transport Committee on Tuesday about what Nats had done to make its systems resilient, Mr Rolfe defended his organisation's staffing arrangements.He said it operated a \"very similar model to almost all of the rest of critical national infrastructure\".He added that there were always engineers on site to solve problems, but more expert \"design engineers\" were needed for particularly complex issues.Mr Rolfe said they were generally in the office during the week but could be on-call outside of normal working hours.He insisted the situation last August \"would have been worse\" without remote working technology.\"We would have had to get them physically in immediately. Now we have the ability for them to log on appropriately and securely, remotely,\" he said.\"In many cases, they fix the problem much more quickly than if they had to come into the office outside of normal hours. It's an absolute advancement in how we deal with these things\".\nAnother point made in a recent interim report by an independent panel (commissioned by the Civil Aviation Authority) was the lack of  \"any multi-agency rehearsal of the management of an incident of this nature and scale\".Mr Rolfe told the committee hearing that Nats wanted to lead an industry-wide \"practice run\" for a disruption scenario, but this would not happen until after the peak summer period.The panel's final report and recommendations are expected later this year.",

While the force did not have an official statement on this when approached by the BBC, there is guidance around fake speed cameras.It is not a criminal offence to do so but those who do could find themselves at risk of some civil litigation. \nGot a story?

Every area has its own factors affecting house prices, so property values would have changed at varying rates in different parts of the country.The figures are based on the building society's own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.On an annual basis, the pace of house price growth slowed from 1.6% in March to 0.6% in April.\nThe Nationwide said that potential first-time buyers were being put off their plans to purchase a property owing to high house prices and the high cost of borrowing.Its survey suggested that about half of those considering buying a first home in the five years, had delayed their plans over the last year.Single first-time buyers recently told the BBC how they faced even tougher conditions, with only one income.Single first-time buyers recently told the BBC how they faced even tougher conditions, with only one income.\nJess Waring-Hughes, a 32 year-old business manager, said she was saving hard to buy on her own but there was little support for people in such circumstances.As a result she has moved back in with her parents while she saves.“It is weird going back to the childhood room and home again,” she said.Earlier in the week, the Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, said demand for smaller homes such as flats had been increasing at a faster rate than bigger properties, owing to the squeeze on affordability.It said there had been a switch in demand, reversing the \"race for space\" that was seen during the Covid pandemic when buyers searched for bigger homes.\nMake overpayments.

        "description": "Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina. ",
        "content": "Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina. \nShe peered out of the window to see Argentine workers surrounding the compound and blockading the entrance with flaming tyres. \n\"It was getting scary because I could see the sky being lit up by the fire. It had become a riot,\" says Ms Ai, who works for a Chinese company extracting lithium from salt flats in the Andes mountains, for use in batteries. \nThe protest, sparked by the firing of a number of Argentine staff, is just one of a growing number of cases of friction between Chinese businesses and host communities, as China - which already dominates the processing of minerals vital to the green economy - expands its involvement in mining them.  \nIt was just 10 years ago that a Chinese company bought the country's first stake in an extraction project within the \"lithium triangle\" of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which holds most of the world's lithium reserves. \nMany further Chinese investments in local mining operations have followed, according to mining publications, and corporate, government and media reports. The BBC calculates that based on their shareholdings, Chinese companies now control an estimated 33% of the lithium at projects currently producing the mineral or those under construction. \nBut as Chinese businesses have expanded, they have faced allegations of abuses similar to those often levelled at other international mining giants. \nFor Ai Qing, the tyre-burning protest was a rude awakening. She had expected a quiet life in Argentina, but found herself involved in conflict mediation because of her knowledge of Spanish. \n\"It wasn't easy,\" she says. \n\"Beyond the language, we have to tone down many things, like how management thinks the employees are simply lazy and too reliant on the union, and how locals think Chinese people are only here to exploit them.\" \nThe BBC Global China Unit has identified at least 62 mining projects across the world, in which Chinese companies have a stake, that are designed to extract either lithium or one of three other minerals key to green technologies - cobalt, nickel and manganese. \nAll are used to make lithium-ion batteries - used in electric vehicles - which, along with solar panels, are now high industrial priorities for China. Some projects are among the largest producers of these minerals in the world.  \nChina has long been a leader in refining lithium and cobalt, with a share of global supply reaching 72% and 68% respectively in 2022, according to the Chatham House think tank. \nIts capacity to refine these and other critical minerals has helped the country reach a point where it made more than half of the electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2023, has 60% of the global manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, and controls at least 80% of each stage in the solar panel supply chain.   \nChina's role in the sector has made these items cheaper and more accessible globally. \nBut it's not only China that will need to mine and process minerals needed for the green economy. The UN says that if the world is to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, their use must increase six-fold by 2040. \nThe US, the UK and the European Union have all developed strategies, meanwhile, to reduce their dependence on Chinese supplies.  \nAs Chinese companies have increased their overseas mining operations, allegations of problems caused by these projects have steadily risen. \nThe Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, an NGO, says such troubles are \"not unique to Chinese mining\" but last year it published a report listing 102 allegations made against Chinese companies involved in extracting critical minerals, ranging from violations of the rights of local communities to damage to ecosystems and unsafe working conditions.  \nThese allegations dated from 2021 and 2022. The BBC has counted more than 40 further allegations that were made in 2023, and reported by NGOs or in the media.  \nPeople in two countries, on opposite sides of the world, also told us their stories.  \nOn the outskirts of Lubumbashi in the far south of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Christophe Kabwita has been leading opposition to the Ruashi cobalt mine, owned by the Jinchuan Group since 2011. \nHe says the open-pit mine, situated 500m from his doorstep, blights people's lives by using explosives to blast away at the rock two or three times per week. Sirens wail when the blasting is about to start, as a signal for everyone to stop what they are doing and take cover.  \n\"Whatever the temperature, whether it's raining or a gale is blowing, we have to leave our homes and go to a shelter near the mine,\" he says. \nThis applies to everyone, including the sick and women who have just given birth, he adds, as nowhere else is safe. \nIn 2017 a teenage girl, Katty Kabazo, was reportedly killed by a flying rock on her way home from school, while other rocks are said to have punched holes into the walls and roofs of local houses. \nA spokesperson from the Ruashi mine, Elisa Kalasa, acknowledged that \"one young kid was in that area - she was not supposed to be there and was affected by the flying rocks\".    \nShe said that since then \"we have improved the technology, and now we have the sort of blasting where there are no flying rocks any more\".  \nHowever, the BBC spoke to a processing manager at the company, Patrick Tshisand, who appeared to give a different picture. He said: \"If we mine, we use explosives. Explosives can cause flying rocks, which can end up in the community because the community is too close to the mine... so we had several accidents like that.\"    \nMs Kalasa also said that between 2006 and 2012 the company compensated more than 300 families to relocate further away from the mine. \nOn Indonesia's remote Obi Island, a mine jointly owned by a Chinese company, Lygend Resources and Technology, and Indonesian mining giant Harita Group has rapidly swallowed up the forests around the village of Kawasi.   \nJatam, a local mining watchdog, says that villagers have been under pressure to move and accept government compensation. Dozens of families have refused to relocate, saying what is on offer is below market value. As a result, some say they have been threatened with legal action for allegedly disrupting a project of national strategic importance.   \nJatam says old-growth forests have been logged to make way for the mine and they've documented how the rivers and ocean have been filled with sediment, polluting what was once a pristine marine environment.    \n\"The water from the river is undrinkable now, it's so contaminated, and the sea, that is usually clear blue, turns red when it rains,\" Nur Hayati, a teacher who lives in Kawasi village, says.     \nIndonesian soldiers have been deployed to the island to protect the mine and when the BBC visited recently, there was a noticeable, increased military presence. Jatam claims soldiers are being used to intimidate, and even assault, people who speak out against the mine. Ms Nur says her community feels the army is there to \"protect the interests of the mine, not the welfare of their own people\". \nThe military's spokesperson in Jakarta said allegations of intimidation \"cannot be proven\" and that while the soldiers were there to \"protect the mine\" they were not there to \"directly interact with locals\".  \nIn a statement, he claimed the relocation of villagers to make way for the mine had been overseen by the police in a \"peaceful and smooth manner\".  \nMs Nur was among a group of villagers who travelled to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in June 2018, to protest against the impact of the mine. But a local government representative, Samsu Abubakar, told the BBC no complaints had been received from the public about environmental damage.    \nHe also shared an official report that concluded Harita Group had been \"compliant with environmental management and monitoring obligations\".    \nHarita itself told us that it \"adheres strictly to ethical business practices and local laws\" and it is \"continuously working to address and mitigate any negative impacts\". \nIt claimed it had not caused widespread deforestation, it monitored the local source of drinking water, and independent tests have confirmed the water met government quality standards. It added that it had not carried out forced evictions or unfair land transactions and had not intimidated anyone.    \nA year ago, the Chinese mining trade body, known as CCCMC, started setting up a grievance mechanism, intended to resolve complaints made against Chinese-owned mining projects. The companies themselves \"lack the ability - both cultural and linguistic\" to interact with local communities or civil society organisations, says a spokesperson, Lelia Li.  \nHowever, the mechanism still isn't fully operating. \nMeanwhile, China's involvement in foreign mining operations seems certain to increase. It's not just a \"geopolitical play\" to control a key market, says Aditya Lolla, the Asia programme director at Ember, a UK-based environmental think tank, it also makes sense from a business perspective.  \n\"Acquisitions are being made by Chinese companies because, for them, it's all about profits,\" he says. \nAs a result, Chinese workers will continue to be sent to mining projects around the world and for them, these projects mostly present a chance to earn good money. \nPeople such as Wang Gang, who has worked for 10 years in Chinese-owned cobalt mines in DR Congo. The 48-year-old lives in company accommodation and eats in the staff canteen, working 10-hour days, seven days a week, with four days' leave per month.  \nHe accepts the separation from his family in Hubei province, because he earns more than he could at home. He also enjoys the clear skies and tall forests of DR Congo.  \nHe communicates with local mine workers in a mixture of French, Swahili, and English, but says: \"We rarely chat, except for work-related matters.\"  \nEven Ai Qing, who speaks the language of her host country fluently, has little interaction with Argentines outside work. She's started seeing a fellow Chinese worker, and they mostly hang out with other people like themselves - being thousands of miles from home pulls everyone closer.  \nA highlight for her is visiting the salt flats high up in the Andes where the lithium is mined and life is \"chill\".   \n\"The altitude sickness always gets me - I can't fall asleep and I can't eat,\" she says. \"But I really do enjoy going up there because things are much simpler, and there are no office politics.\"  \nAi Qing and Wang Gang are pseudonyms \nAdditional reporting by Emery Makumeno, Byobe Malenga, Lucien Kahozy",

The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop.\nThe feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year, when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the \"big three\" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter.\nThe seemingly innocuous comment went unremarked for months. Then, in the middle of March, Lamar delivered a fiery verse on Like That, declaring that there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nIn April, Drake released the first of two diss tracks, titled Push Ups, in which he mocked Lamar's height as well as his collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\nLater that month, Drake dropped another song, Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he taunted Lamar, calling him a coward for failing to respond. \nThe track controversially used AI technology to imitate the voices of Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur - one of Lamar's heroes. \nAfter a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.After a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.\nLamar's Euphoria similarly criticises the use of AI, saying it would \"make [Tu]pac turn in his grave\". \nHe also asks \"Am I battlin' ghost or AI?\" - a reference to the accusation that Drake has used ghostwriters in the past.\nLamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"Lamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"\nA former Pulitzer Prize winner for his fourth album, Damn, Lamar uses the song to display the dexterity of his voice, switching between flows and rhythmic meters throughout. \nHe even appears to be mimicking Drake's Toronto accent in the closing bars.\nHowever, fans who were hoping for a slam-dunk conclusion to the rap beef were disappointed.\nLamar conceded: \"I like Drake with with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough,\" and declined to respond to Drake naming his wife on a previous song. \n\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\nThe rift has drawn in several other rappers over the last few months, with stars such as Kanye West, The Weeknd and Rick Ross releasing songs that reference the fall-out.\nDrake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.Drake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.\nIt's presumably intended as a parody of Lamar's lyrics - but Drake seems to have forgotten how the scene ends.\n\"I hate the way I don't hate you,\" says Stiles, choking back tears. \"Not even close, not even a little bit.\"",

Four people including two police officers were injured.\nThe Palace said the King's thoughts were particularly with \"the family of the young victim\" who lost his life.\nA man, 36, was arrested and is in hospital being treated for injuries sustained when a vehicle crashed.\nThe Metropolitan Police said the condition of the man, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, meant he had not yet been interviewed.\nPolice say they do not believe the attack was terror-related and was not a \"targeted\" attack.\nThey were called to reports of a car crashing into a house and people being stabbed at about 07:00 BST on Tuesday.\nThe suspect was then seen leaping over people's garden fences and walking around with a sword. He was eventually cornered and Tasered in a front garden.\nFootage shared on social media showed a man with a long knife in Laing Close.\nWitness James Fernando said he had seen the suspect ask one of his neighbours to take his phone and \"tell whoever was on the phone his location\".\nThe 39-year-old said the neighbour had soon noticed the sword and started running.\nAs she fled, the woman shouted to another neighbour, a boy on his way to school, who was then struck by the attacker as he turned around, he said.\nOther eyewitnesses saw the suspect leaping over people's garden fences, before he was eventually tasered by police.\nThe 14-year-old boy died from stab wounds shortly after being taken to hospital. His identity has not been released and his family are being supported by trained police staff.\nTwo other members of the public are still in hospital but their conditions are not considered to be life-threatening, say police.\nTwo Metropolitan Police officers have \"significant but not life-threatening\" injuries and will require surgery, the Met confirmed.\nPolice said they were not looking for any more suspects.\nThey added that there had been speculation about the man's background including police contact with him.

        "content": "Scientists are trying to create a new type of bread that is just as healthy as wholemeal but looks and tastes like its white counterpart.Aimed at lovers of white bread, the project has been funded by the government to improve the health benefits of UK food.The researchers plan to add small amounts of peas, beans and cereals to the bread mix, as well as bran and wheat germ that are normally removed from white flour.Bread makers have attempted to make their white loaves healthier in the past by adding bran to their flour, but their customers didn't like the taste and texture. \nThe research project is still in its early stages. Dr Catherine Howarth of Aberystwyth University, who is one of its leaders, said scientists had begun to analyse the detailed chemical composition of existing white flour.She said boosting its nutritional values to the levels of wholemeal bread while keeping the taste and feel of white bread was a delicate balancing act.It involved adding back smaller quantities of the wheat germ and part of the bran that is taken out in the milling process, she said, as well as adding other grains that are richer in vitamins, minerals and fibre such as quinoa, teff, sorghum and millet. Green peas and chickpeas would provide extra protein.\n\"We want to find out exactly what vitamins and minerals are lost during the milling process,\" said Dr Howarth.\"Using other cereals we can enhance the iron, zinc and vitamin levels and most importantly the fibre content, because white bread has very little fibre, which is so important for good health.\"Once Dr Howarth has come up with some possible recipes, Chris Holister, a product development manager for Gloucestershire flour producer Shipton Mill, will turn them into bread.“Most people know that wholemeal bread is better for you, but a lot of them are put off by the flavour, or because it’s not what they are used to and they are simply not interested,” he said of the challenge.The final stage will be to test the new bread out on people to see if they can tell it apart from sliced supermarket white loaves.Mr Holister used me as a guinea pig for an early prototype made from a mixture of normal white flour and some added grains and peas.It was crustier than the white loaves you get from the supermarket - but otherwise looked and tasted like white bread. But there is a lot more work to be done.It is hoped that a product could be on supermarket shelves in about two years' time.\nThe research team believe that their approach will succeed because they are adding only the inner layer of the bran, which is less strongly flavoured and coloured. They say they will need to add less of it because they are using other highly nutritious but less strongly flavoured grains.White bread has to have minerals and vitamins added to it by law to make up for the goodness that's lost in the refining process. But Dr Amanda Lloyd, who is working with Dr Howarth and Mr Holister, believes that the use of natural ingredients would make the sliced white loaf even healthier. “If the nutritional quality of bog standard bread is improved,” said Dr Lloyd, “then the quality of  people’s life and their health and wellbeing will improve.”Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City University, who is independent of the research team, said that the work could be an important step forward in improving people’s health.“The British have had a love affair with white bread for more than a century and nutritionists have longed to get more people to eat the whole grain,\" he said. \"The new research seems like a really interesting approach to doing that. \"Critics would say that it is tricking people into improving their diet, but nutritionists would say it doesn’t matter how it’s done - it’s important to get it down people’s throats to improve their health! \"But the jury's out as to whether this new approach will work,” he added.\n\nAccording to the British Diabetic Association, the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes may be up to 30% lower in people who regularly eat wholegrains and the risk of bowel cancer may be also reduced.According to the British Diabetic Association, the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes may be up to 30% lower in people who regularly eat wholegrains and the risk of bowel cancer may be also reduced.The BDA says surveys show that 95% of adults don’t eat enough wholegrains and nearly one in three of us get none at all.That was not always the case, according to Chris Holister.“It used to be the case that white bread was for the upper class because it was a refined product and a lot more expensive than wholemeal bread. So that led to everyone else wanting white bread because it made them look better,\" he said.“Then some people switched back the other way when research showed that it is more nutritious.”But Chris doesn’t think it will come full circle because so many people are so accustomed to eating sliced white bread.\"White bread is so much cheaper than wholemeal because firms are geared up to producing it. And it's also what most people are used to.\"\nFollow Pallab on X, formerly known as TwitterFollow Pallab on X, formerly known as Twitter",

        "content": "The competition to become Donald Trump's vice-presidential candidate is heating up.\nMr Trump has teased crowds with a lengthy shortlist. However, if tradition holds we still have months before learning his selection.\nFormer VP Mike Pence will not be selected. The two fell out over the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot, and Mr Pence does not plan to vote for his old boss in November.\nHere is a look at names rumoured to be in the mix.\nSenator Tim Scott, arguably the most prominent black Republican in the country, was among the competitors Mr Trump defeated in the party's primary contest.\nMr Scott, 58, pitched his brand of optimistic conservativism, in a play for the influential evangelical Christian vote in early voting states, but his campaign never caught fire.\nAfter struggling to raise money, and three lacklustre debate performances, he exited and quickly endorsed Mr Trump.\nIt was his rousing remarks at a Trump campaign rally before the New Hampshire primary that elevated him as a top contender for vice-president.\n\"We need Donald Trump,\" he said, before appearing on stage during his fellow Republican's victory speech.\nHe told Mr Trump: he said to Mr Trump: \"I just love you.\" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician.\"He told Mr Trump: he said to Mr Trump: \"I just love you.\" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician.\"\nSince then, Mr Trump has often remarked that Mr Scott is \"much better [at advocating] for me than he was for himself\".\nAnother of Mr Trump's fallen primary opponents, Doug Burgum, 67, is in his second term as governor of North Dakota.\nMr Burgum made little impact as a presidential candidate but has returned to the campaign trail with his endorsement of Mr Trump.\nA social conservative and fiscal hawk, he said in 2023 that he would never conduct business with Mr Trump because \"you're judged by the company you keep\".\nMr Burgum began his career with a small software start-up later acquired by Microsoft and his years of entrepreneurship have earned him a billionaire fortune.\nHe is reported to have impressed Mr Trump with his low-drama demeanour and political know-how - attributes that led to the selection of Mr Pence in 2016.\nElise Stefanik, 39, is a New York congresswoman and the highest-ranking Republican woman in the US House of Representatives.\nThe once-moderate Trump-hesitant Republican has drifted to the right in recent years, and is now widely considered one of Mr Trump's most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill, even joining his defence at his first impeachment trial in 2020.\nIn recent months, she has also risen to modest fame in media circles, with her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents and elevation of the issue of antisemitism on US college campuses.In recent months, she has also risen to modest fame in media circles, with her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents and elevation of the issue of antisemitism on US college campuses.\nShe has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\". \nMr Trump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Mr Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Mr Trump's small hands. \nThe Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season.\nThe son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\nAt only 52 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Mr Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote.\nJD Vance, 39, the junior senator from Ohio, has rallied support for Mr Trump on several occasions in recent months.\nThe Yale-educated former venture capitalist wrote the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his blue-collar upbringing in the \"rust-belt\" Midwest. \nOnce a self-identified \"never-Trumper\", Mr Vance refashioned himself when he ran for the Senate in 2022 with Mr Trump's crucial endorsement.\nIn office, he has championed many of the issues that animate Mr Trump's base. \nMr Vance believes he would be of better use to a future Trump administration in the Senate, but he has not ruled out being vice-president. \n\"I want to help him however I can,\" he recently said.\nKristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, once topped a poll taken by mostly Trump diehards on who he should pick as his vice-president.\nMs Noem, 52, rose to national prominence with appearances on Fox News, especially when she flouted mask mandates and other restrictions during the pandemic.\nHer star was very much on the rise until the release of a memoir in 2024, in which she recounted the story of \"hating\" and then shooting her 14-month-old dog, because it wasn't a good hunting companion. Cricket was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\", she said.Her star was very much on the rise until the release of a memoir in 2024, in which she recounted the story of \"hating\" and then shooting her 14-month-old dog, because it wasn't a good hunting companion. Cricket was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\", she said.\nShe also shot a goat she thought was \"nasty\" and \"mean\".\nThe story brought almost universal condemnation, and her shot at being VP may be all but dead.\nByron Donalds, 45, has helped raise the profile of black conservatism.\nBorn in New York to a single mother, Mr Donalds worked in banking, insurance and finance before entering local politics in Florida in 2012.\nAfter four years in the Florida House of Representatives, he has served since 2020 in the US House, representing the right-wing flank of his party in Washington.\nAsked in November if he would accept the role of vice-president in a second Trump term, the congressman said: \"I mean, who wouldn't?\" \nAs a Democrat she was the first Hindu member of the US Congress. Now Tulsi Gabbard may be the biggest dark horse on Mr Trump's shortlist.\nA decade ago, the Iraq War veteran and US Army reservist served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.\nHer time in Congress, from 2013 to 2021, was marked by frequent criticisms of the Obama administration and US military interventionism.\nShe ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with her most notable moment being a fierce critique of Kamala Harris - now the vice-president - over her past as a prosecutor in California.\nMs Gabbard, 42, then beefed up her contributions to Fox News and announced in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party.\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this month that Mr Trump has spoken with Ms Gabbard - an outspoken critic of Ukraine aid - about foreign policy and managing the Pentagon.",

        "published_date": "2024-05-01",
        "authors": "By Bernd Debusmann Jr",
        "description": "The US Drug Enforcement Administration plans to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a historic shift in US drug policy. ",
        "content": "The US Drug Enforcement Administration plans to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a historic shift in US drug policy. \nAt a federal level, marijuana is classified as a \"Schedule I\" drug, a category it shares with heroin, ecstasy and LSD. \nInstead, it would be included among \"Schedule III\" drugs, which are considered less likely to be abused. \nThe move would be the most significant US drug policy change in over 50 years. \nThe Department of Justice sent its proposal to the White House Office on Management and Budget (OMB) on Tuesday, the department confirmed in a statement. \nOnce the proposal is published in the US federal register, a public comment period will begin, after which it will be reviewed by an administrative judge before the change is formalised and published.\nWhile marijuana, more widely known as cannabis, remains illegal at the federal level, 38 individual states have legalised it for medical purposes, and 24 have legalised it for recreational use.\nThe announcement sent the share prices of US cannabis industry companies soaring by between 15% and 67%. Canadian firms also enjoyed large rises.\nSince 1971, marijuana has been a Schedule I drug, meaning that - in the federal government's view - it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" \nSchedule III substances, on the other hand, are defined by the DEA as drugs \"with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological abuse\". \nOther drugs in this category include Tylenol with codeine, steroids, testosterone and ketamine. \nDrugs in the Schedule III category are still controlled, and their unauthorised trafficking could still lead to federal criminal prosecution, although the penalties are less severe. \nIn practice, the move could also undercut the vast black market for the drug that continues to exist even in parts of the country where marijuana's legal sale are regulated and subject to tax. \n\"When you legalise a compound, far more people would go to the legal market, just because it's simple and people don't have access to the black market. The illicit market would certainly dwindle,\" Dr Carl Hart, a psychologist and neuroscientist from Columbia University who specialises in drug use and addiction told the BBC. \nThis shift, in turn, could ultimately help further drive down the already declining number of marijuana arrests made in the US each year. \n\"That's extremely important,\" Dr Hart said. \"Cannabis arrests used to be well over a million every year, and as a result of legalisation in various states, that number has dropped dramatically. With this move, it should drop even further.\" \n\"That means fewer people will have to interact with law enforcement,\" he added. \"A lot of people get their introduction to the criminal justice system through marijuana.\"\nIn recent years, however, the overwhelming majority of marijuana arrests in the US are conducted at the state level, rather than the federal level. In some of those states - such as Florida or Georgia  - marijuana has yet to be legalised at the local level. \nKevin McMunigal, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that a federal reclassification would likely \"have a ripple effect\" down to the state level. \n\"It would have a symbolic impact,\" he added. \"State legislators might start thinking about it. In the past it was deemed very tough for a state to deregulate when the federal government still makes it a serious crime.\" \nReclassification could also make government-authorised clinical studies of the drug's medical benefits easier. \nIndustry groups have also suggested that it could help ease the tax burden on businesses in the cannabis industry, which can rise to 70% in some cases. \nThe move to reschedule marijuana comes amid a huge shift in public opinion and acceptance over its use. \nA Gallup poll conducted last year, for example, found that 70% of US adults support legalisation, compared to just 30% in 2000. \n\"It's all about public perception,\" Dr Hart said. \"It's public perception, not reality, that drives what we arrest people for.\" \nThe reclassification proposal also comes less than two years after US President Joe Biden called for a review of federal marijuana laws and pardoned thousands of US marijuana users convicted of \"simple possession\" under federal law.\n\"Criminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,\" Mr Biden said last year. \"Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs.\"\nLast week, 21 Democratic lawmakers also sent a letter urging the DEA and Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop marijuana from its list of controlled-substances entirely and instead treat it like alcohol. \n\"It is time for the DEA to act,\" the letter said. \"Right now, the Administration has the opportunity to resolve more than 50 years of failed, racially discriminatory marijuana policy.\" ",

He was shown an email sent by Mr Jenkins on 25 February 2010.Referring to a trial where he had been asked to give expert evidence, Mr Jenkins wrote: “This is another example of postmasters trying to get away with ‘Horizon has taken my money'.\"Mr Flemington told the Inquiry: \"I was surprised when I saw this.\" He said he couldn't recall any request from the Post Office for expert evidence.Mr Jenkins was later to give evidence in a number of cases, where he testified to the robustness of the Horizon system – evidence which was seen as crucial in winning those cases.However, by 2013 concerns had been raised about his evidence. Barrister Simon Clarke wrote a memo circulated within the Post Office which warned that Mr Jenkins was aware of flaws in the Horizon system.Knowledge of those bugs would have helped the defence in those cases, and Mr Clarke said the IT expert did not disclose them when he should have.\"[He] failed to disclose material known to him but which undermines his expert opinion… in plain breach of his duty as an expert witness,” Mr Clarke’s advice said.It said his credibility was “fatally undermined”, and recommended that he did not testify in current or future trials.Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for alleged perjury.A lawyer for Mr Jenkins told the BBC in March it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to comment ahead of him giving evidence to the Inquiry in June.\nMeanwhile, another barrister who acted for the Post Office also appeared on Tuesday. Harry Bowyer was an employee for Cartwright King solicitors, the firm which acted for the Post Office in private prosecutions.Mr Bowyer did not act on behalf of the Post Office in court but will return to give more evidence on Wednesday ",

        "content": "A recent report on women who contracted HIV after receiving a \"vampire facial\" has raised questions about the safety of some cosmetic procedures.\nAt least three women were infected at a spa in New Mexico in 2018,  according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that said the cases shed light on new ways the infection can spread.At least three women were infected at a spa in New Mexico in 2018,  according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that said the cases shed light on new ways the infection can spread.\nThey are believed to be the first-ever HIV transmissions related to a cosmetic procedure documented in the US.\nBut what exactly is a \"vampire facial\", and how did the women contract HIV after receiving it? And what can people do to keep themselves safe from infection when getting cosmetic treatments?\nHere is a breakdown of what we know and what experts recommend.\nThe term is a colloquial one for platelet-rich plasma - or PRP - facials. \nIt involves drawing a patient's blood and then separating out platelet-rich plasma from it using a centrifuge. The plasma is then injected back into the face through tiny needle punctures. \nThe procedure is said to help repair the skin's barrier by stimulating the production of new collagen and elastin, which can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and acne scars.\nIt has been around for a while - reality television star Kim Kardashian shared a selfie post-procedure in 2013 where her face appeared bloody. \nA few years later Ms Kardashian said that she would not get the treatment again, writing on her website that it was \"really rough and painful for me.\" \nThe treatment could cost anywhere between $1,000 to $2,000 (£1,600) at a licensed medical spa, according to estimates from providers online. \nIn summer of 2018, the CDC became aware of an American woman, aged between 40 and 50, who tested positive for HIV while she was abroad.\nThe woman reported no history of injection drug use or recent blood transfusions, and did not have recent sexual contact with anyone other than her current partner.\nShe did, however, report getting a vampire facial earlier that year at a spa in New Mexico.\nA CDC investigation into the spa - which also provided other injection services, including Botox - later revealed that it was unlicensed and that it had \"multiple unsafe infection control practices.\"\nThis included \"unlabelled tubes of blood and medical injectables\" that were stored in a kitchen fridge next to food, as well as \"unwrapped syringes\" scattered in drawers and on counters.\nSome of the blood vials also showed signs of being reused, and the CDC had identified at least one client who had tested positive for HIV before visiting the spa. \nThe health agency has since tied the spa to five cases of HIV, including four women who had all received a vampire facial treatment between May and September of 2018 and a man who was romantically linked with one of the women.\nThe late stage of the HIV infections for the man and woman in a relationship indicated they had contracted the disease before the facial, the CDC said\nThe spa was forced to close in late 2018, and its former owner, 62-year-old Maria de Lourdes Ramos De Ruiz, is serving a three-and-a-half year prison sentence. She pled guilty in 2022 to practicing medicine without a license.\nThere have been hundreds of published medical research papers and trials that suggest the treatments are effective for some sports injuries, acne, eczema and other skin conditions.There have been hundreds of published medical research papers and trials that suggest the treatments are effective for some sports injuries, acne, eczema and other skin conditions.\nThe American Academy of Dermatology Association says the procedure itself, when done correctly, appears to be safe.The American Academy of Dermatology Association says the procedure itself, when done correctly, appears to be safe.\n\"You may have a bit of pain, bruising and swelling afterwards,\" the association says. \"These tend to go away within a few days.\" \nThe biggest risk comes from the way the blood is handled by the facility providing the treatment. \n\"It's essential that the blood removed from your body be kept sterile. Otherwise, you could develop an infection,\" the association says. \nIt is also important to ensure that the blood being injected back belongs to the client, and not someone else, as the recipient could get very sick otherwise.\nExperts say that those looking to get cosmetic treatments should research the provider beforehand to make sure the facility is licensed. They should also note how medical equipment - like needles - are being handled by staff.\nVampire facials are not the only cosmetic treatment to make recent headlines after being linked to serious illness.\nUS health officials warned last week of a botulism outbreak tied to counterfeit Botox, which has sickened 22 people in 11 states - some of whom have since been in hospital.\nBotulism is a serious illness with symptoms including blurred vision, difficulty swallowing and breathing, slurred speech and fatigue. \nBotox injection is a popular treatment used to smooth wrinkles and make skin appear younger. Injections typically cost around $530 a treatment. \nLike with the vampire facials, the CDC advises those looking to get Botox injections to research the treatment provider beforehand, and to make sure that the Botox being used is FDA-approved and purchased from a reliable source.",

        "content": "World of Warcraft is celebrating its 20th birthday this year, but it's just cancelled its biggest party. \nFans of the online game have gathered in Anaheim, California, every year since 2005 for BlizzCon.\nThe convention was a place to meet fellow fans of the series, dress up in your best cosplay and get a first look at what was coming next in the huge fantasy world of Azeroth.\nBut game maker Activision Blizzard has announced it's called off the 2024 edition of the popular event.\nIt's assured disappointed fans that the event will return in future, but hasn't said when, and promised a series of smaller-scale events instead.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, some fans were quick to point the finger at Warcraft's new owners, Microsoft. The tech giant bought Activision Blizzard last year for $69bn (£56bn) in the biggest acquisition in gaming history.Perhaps unsurprisingly, some fans were quick to point the finger at Warcraft's new owners, Microsoft. The tech giant bought Activision Blizzard last year for $69bn (£56bn) in the biggest acquisition in gaming history.\nAmong gamers there's been speculation about what the Xbox owner might do with its newly owned titles, which also include household-name franchises Call of Duty and Candy Crush.\nMost of the talk has centred around whether Microsoft would bring some of its new titles to Game Pass - its Netflix-style subscription service seen as an increasingly important part of its gaming business. \nThe other major development since the buyout was the announcement that Microsoft had laid off 1,900 of its 22,000 workers in its gaming division.The other major development since the buyout was the announcement that Microsoft had laid off 1,900 of its 22,000 workers in its gaming division.\nThese were reported to have largely affected Activision Blizzard staff, and the developer also cancelled work on a survival game project widely known as Odyssey. \nBut when BBC Newsbeat spoke to two of World of Warcraft's most senior bosses earlier this month - and before the BlizzCon announcement - they insisted they weren't expecting any major changes for the franchise.\nVice president and executive producer Holly Longdale said that \"so far\" the developer had Microsoft's \"full support to do everything we've got to deliver for our audience\".\nShe said she viewed the merger deal as a positive thing for players, because it allowed the Warcraft team to exchange ideas with other studios owned by Microsoft.\nDescribing this as a \"very rare special benefit\", Holly said she'd already had conversations with teams behind Minecraft and RPG The Elder Scrolls to find out how they can learn from each other.\nWhen asked if this might mean a crossover between the franchises in the future, she told Newsbeat: \"I have nothing to announce right now. We're all optimistic. Who knows? It's early days\".\nBut she did say that some changes inspired by other studios have already found their way into Warcraft.\nOne example is a new setting that allows players with severe arachnophobia to remove the eight-legged creatures - which feature heavily in the world - from the game.\nHolly said that particular feature was brought over from games such as Grounded - a co-operative survival adventure from Microsoft studio Obsidian.\nBuying Activision Blizzard has also boosted Microsoft's financial results. Published last week, its gaming division saw a big increase in revenue which was mostly driven by the purchase.\nBut its Xbox console sales had dropped by 31% year-on-year.\nGaming boss Phil Spencer has insisted Microsoft is not turning its back on consoles, but the company has been expanding its multi-platform strategy by releasing previously exclusive games on other companies' hardware.Gaming boss Phil Spencer has insisted Microsoft is not turning its back on consoles, but the company has been expanding its multi-platform strategy by releasing previously exclusive games on other companies' hardware.\nHolly told Newsbeat she believes World of Warcraft - which is currently unavailable on consoles - could play a part in this and wants to broaden the appeal of the game. \n\"We're always looking to find ways where we can expand our audience,\" she said.\n\"Ultimately, that challenge will never end because we want to share World of Warcraft with everyone around the world.\"\nIn recent years the game has added new ways to play that appeal to more casual gamers who don't want to spend hours levelling up their characters or don't want to battle other players. \nBut one of the biggest barriers to attracting new players is the reputation some online games have for toxic speech and behaviour.\nIt's not unique to World of Warcraft and the game's associate design director, Maria Hamilton, told Newsbeat it was something Blizzard was trying their best to address but will probably never completely eliminate.\n\"Any online experience runs the risk of encountering someone who's having a bad day,\" she said. \n\"We have good reporting and good methods of watching for problematic players, toxic players.\" \nRepresentation is a big topic in the games industry at the moment and World of Warcraft has previously been criticised for including characters deemed by some players to be racist or misogynistic.\n\"I think representation wasn't always the best,\" Maria told Newsbeat. \n\"The image of some of our character races might not be entirely wonderful within the lens of today\". \nMaria said she wished some of the more problematic examples could be erased from the game's past, but she says the company is trying to avoid repeats by bringing in external diversity consultants. \nCompared with Warcraft's launch 20 years ago, games are increasingly competing not just for our money, but for our time and attention too. \nHolly said she sees streaming services like Netflix as a major competitor in 2024. \nDespite the challenges ahead, both Holly and Maria said they're optimistic about World of Warcraft's next 20 years. \n\"We've got some pretty incredible ideas on the way,\" said Holly. \n\"As part of Microsoft, we feel there's some pretty boundless potential on the way\".\nFor this year though, that won't include the game's annual convention. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "content": "In January, thousands braved the freezing cold at Delhi's Red Fort to hear Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak. \nHis message was \"Viksit Bharat 2047\", a promise to make India a developed nation by 2047. \nIt's the latest catchphrase from a man known for his penchant for catchy taglines. \n\"Developed India\" is an imprecise pledge, but in the 10 years since Mr Modi first stormed to power, he has been trying to lay the foundations for a period of economic boom. \nThe prime minister and his government inherited an economy that was teetering on the precipice. Growth was slowing and investor confidence was low. A dozen Indian billionaires had gone bankrupt, saddling the country's banks with enormous unpaid loans that had crippled their capacity to lend. \nNow, 10 years on, India's growth is outpacing other major economies, its banks are strong, and the government's finances are stable despite a painful pandemic. India surpassed the UK as the fifth largest economy last year and according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, it's on track to overtake Japan and Germany and hit the third spot by 2027.\nThere is undoubtedly an air of optimism in the country. It successfully hosted the G20, became the first to send a rocket near the Moon's south pole, and has birthed a few dozen unicorns. The soaring stock markets have also had a trickle-down effect on the wealth of its middle class. \nOn the face of it \"Modinomics\" - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s economic vision for India - appears to be working. But dig deeper, and the picture is more complex. For a vast swathe of the country's 1.4 billion people who live on the margins of sustenance, it's not boomtime just as yet. \nSo who are the winners and losers of Modinomics? \nMr Modi's push for digital governance has begun to transform the lives of some of the country's poorest people. \nToday, Indians in the remotest corners of the country can buy many daily goods without cash, paying as little as 20p for a packet of bread using a QR code on their phone.\nUnderpinning this digital revolution is a three-layer system of governance, which includes universal identity cards, a payments infrastructure that enables click-of-a-button money transfer, and a data pillar that gives people access to crucial personal documents like tax returns.  \nLinking hundreds of millions of bank accounts to this \"digital stack\" has cut red tape and corruption. \nEstimates suggest that up to March 2021, an equivalent of about 1.1% of GDP was saved due to digital governance, allowing the government to dole out a volley of social subsidies, cash handouts and also spend on infrastructure building, without running high deficits. \nEverywhere you go in India there are cranes and JCB machines at work giving its creaky public infrastructure a shiny makeover. \nTake a look at this slick first underwater metro in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. \nThere's no doubt this country is getting a facelift.\nBuilding new roads, airports, ports and metros has been the centrepiece of Mr Modi's economic policy. He spent over $100bn annually in infrastructure spending (capital expenditure) in the past three years. \nNearly 54,000 km (33,554 miles) of national highways were built between 2014 and 2024 - which is twice the length of the preceding 10 years. \nThe government has also considerably eased up the bureaucracy, which has been a major bugbear of India's economy for decades. \nBut Mr Modi's policies haven't delivered for all. \nThe brutal lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, the lingering after-effects of a cash ban in 2016, and faulty implementation of a new goods and services tax - a long pending reform meant to streamline the country's welter of indirect taxes - have had far-reaching structural consequences on India's economy.  The brutal lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, the lingering after-effects of a cash ban in 2016, and faulty implementation of a new goods and services tax - a long pending reform meant to streamline the country's welter of indirect taxes - have had far-reaching structural consequences on India's economy.  \nThe country's vast unorganised sector - small enterprises that form the backbone of this country - are still reeling under the impact of some of these decisions. \nAnd the private sector is not committing big investments. As a proportion of GDP, private investments slumped to barely 19.6% in 2020-21 from a peak of 27.5% in 2007-08. \nIn January, thousands gathered outside government recruitment centres in the northern city of Lucknow to go to Israel for jobs in the construction industry. My colleague Archana Shukla was on location. \nThe desperation of these workers showed India's jobs crisis is real. And it is crushing aspirations everywhere. \n\"I'm the first master's degree holder in my family,\" says Rukaiya Bepari, a 23-year-old graduate in the town of Miraj in western India. \n\"But there's no industry where I live. So I'm now taking tuitions. It doesn't pay much.\" \nNeither Rukaiya nor her brother have had full-time work for the last two years. They're not alone.\nThe share of educated youths among all unemployed people increased from 54.2% in 2000 to 65.7% in 2022 according to latest figures by the Indian Labour Organization.\nThere's also been no significant growth of real wages in India since 2014, according to numbers computed by noted developmental economist Jean Dreze. \nIndia \"risks squandering its demographic dividend\" - the economic growth potential from a big working-age population - the World Bank's regional economist said in an interview to the Financial Times recently.  \nJob creation is a problem Mr Modi has been unable to solve. \nRight off the back of his victory in 2014, the prime minister launched an ambitious Make In India campaign to turn India into the world's factory. In 2020, his government doled out $25bn in incentives to companies across sectors from semi-conductors to mobile electronics in order to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities. \nBut success has been elusive. \nYes, the likes of Foxconn - which makes iPhones for Apple - are moving their supply chains to India as part of the global \"China plus one\" diversification strategy. Other major global giants like Micron and Samsung have also been enthused to invest. But the numbers are not significant yet.  Yes, the likes of Foxconn - which makes iPhones for Apple - are moving their supply chains to India as part of the global \"China plus one\" diversification strategy. Other major global giants like Micron and Samsung have also been enthused to invest. But the numbers are not significant yet.  \nManufacturing's share as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant in the last decade despite these efforts. \nGrowth in exports was also faster under Mr Modi's predecessors.\n\"Even if India's manufacturing grows 8% per year till 2050 and China's stagnates at the 2022 level, India's manufacturing size in 2050 will still not match that of China's in 2022,\" says Prof Vidya Mahambare of the Great Lakes Institute of Management.\nLack of a large scale industry means half of India's population still depends on agriculture for their livelihoods - which is increasingly becoming unprofitable.\nA direct impact of this? Squeezed household budgets.\nAt 3%, the growth in overall private consumption expenditure - the money people spend on buying things -  is the slowest in 20 years. \nAnd household debt has touched an all-time high, even as financial savings plunged to their lowest levels, according to new research. And household debt has touched an all-time high, even as financial savings plunged to their lowest levels, according to new research. \nMany economists argue that the nature of India's economic growth post pandemic has been uneven, or \"K-shaped\" - where the rich have thrived, while the poor continue to struggle. India may be the fifth largest global economy at an aggregate level, but on a per person basis, it still languishes at the 140th rank. \nAnd inequality has widened to a hundred-year high according to research from the World Inequality Database. No surprises then that election campaign discourse recently has been rife with chatter around wealth redistribution and inheritance taxes. \nA three day pre-wedding ceremony of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's son recently offered a glimpse into the country's new gilded age. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump were in attendance. Rihanna shook a leg with Bollywood's biggest celebrities, while the Ambani women flashed diamonds and jewellery once part of the Mughal empire's collection.

Rihanna shook a leg with Bollywood's biggest celebrities, while the Ambani women flashed diamonds and jewellery once part of the Mughal empire's collection. \nLuxury brands making cars, watches and liquor have been growing faster than India's more mass-market companies, according to Arnab Mitra, who researches Indian consumer brands at Goldman Sachs.\nViral Acharya, a professor at NYU Stern, says a handful of the biggest conglomerates have grown \"at the expense of the smallest firms\". \nThe super-rich, he says, have benefited from sharp tax cuts and a conscious policy of creating \"national champions\" in which prized public assets like ports and airports have been preferentially given to a few companies to build or run.\nLatest court revelations show many of them have also been India's top political donors to the ruling BJP. \nAll combined, this presents an inconsistent picture of India's economy. But for all its problems, the country is on the runway for take-off, say experts.  \n\"India's next decade could resemble China's path (of hyper growth) from 2007 through 2012,\" analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a widely discussed paper. \nThey add that the country has many advantages - a young demographic, the geopolitics of global de-risking from China and a clean-up of sectors like real estate. Other megatrends like digitalisation, a transition to clean energy and growth in global offshoring will propel future growth, say experts. \nThe infra push is also something that will have long-term payoffs. By making improvements in roads, power supply and turnaround time at ports - India is finally \"creating an environment in which manufacturing can flourish\", says DK Joshi, CRISIL's India economist.\nBut along with the focus on \"physical capital\", Mr Modi needs to pay heed to creating \"human capital\", says Dr Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of India's central bank. \nIndian children aren't learning as well as they should to face up to the world of artificial intelligence. A quarter of those aged 14 to 18 can't read simple text fluently, according to a report published by the non-profit Pratham Foundation. \nCovid-19 dealt a major blow to students, who couldn't attend school for nearly two years. But the government has continued to underfund education, and healthcare. \nIn its first decade, Modinomics appears to have delivered for a select few. But for many the jar, as it appears, is still half empty. \n\"We will grow old before we grow rich\" if  growth isn't faster and more equitable,  says Dr Rajan.",

I've had to really be resourceful.\"\nMs Jones brings more than 20 years of technical expertise in software engineering and product management to the role. \nBut despite having already been vice-president at Sonos and chief executive of Slack, she says the path to success for women in the technology sector is often riddled with hurdles and setbacks - not least the lack of representation. \n\"I definitely have been in many situations in recent years where I was the only woman in the room,\" Ms Jones says.\n\"But I'm really using this as a platform to ensure that I'm not the only woman in the room anymore.\"\nMs Jones cites the support of a network of other female leaders, including Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, as a source of inspiration and encouragement. \n\"The number of CEO women that are out there that have reached out, that have welcomed me into their small but mighty group, has been phenomenal,\" she says. \nEncouraging women to back themselves, Ms Jones says: \"Don't self-doubt. \n\"Don't waste any energy on that - just believe in yourself and take a leap.\" \nBumble styles itself as a female-friendly app - it is the woman who has to \"make the first move\" before two users can connect.\nIt is attempting to take that further with a feature that allows female users to set a question to which their matches can respond.\nThe big question for Bumble though is whether this tinkering can turn its fortunes around.\nShares in the dating app have fallen by two-thirds since its 2021 initial public offering, with its value now closer to $4bn (£3.2bn).  \nAnd its largest institutional shareholder, Blackstone, recently offloaded a 10% stake at the heavily discounted price of $300m. \nThere is intense competition within the $7bn dating market, which continues to be dominated by established players such as Match Group, known for its acquisition of rising contenders, including Hinge.\nIt seems Ms Jones will have to keep beating the odds if Bumble is to avoid things going stale.",

        "description": "Florida's six-week abortion ban has come into force, closing the door - for now - on the last abortion access point in the US South. ",
        "content": "Florida's six-week abortion ban has come into force, closing the door - for now - on the last abortion access point in the US South. \nAnti-abortion campaigners have celebrated the new legislation - which replaces an existing 15-week law - as the gold standard of abortion policy and a major victory in the country's battle over abortion access. \nBut pro-choice campaigners say the ban will push an overstretched system to the brink. \nThey worry the new law in Florida, which had been the last state in the region without a near-total ban, will effectively cut off abortion access for more than 21 million women of reproductive age across nearly a dozen states.\n\"This essentially creates an abortion desert in the south-east part of our country,\" said Michelle Quesada, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. \"This will be devastating.\" \nBut the change may be undone as soon as November, when Floridians will vote on a ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which could protect abortion access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nBoth the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.Both the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.\nAfter that landmark ruling in June 2022, most Republican-controlled states moved to restrict abortion outright or at six weeks gestation, a point at which many women do not yet know they are pregnant. \nFlorida was an outlier. \nAbortion there was legal until 15 weeks, making it a relative haven for women seeking the procedure in the region. \nAfter Roe v Wade was overturned, Florida became \"one of the main points of access for abortion care within the formal healthcare system in the south\", said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute.\nMore than 84,000 abortions took place in Florida last year - a 12% jump from 2020.\nMore than half of that increase is attributed to out-of-state patients, Mr Maddow-Zimmet said, an estimated 9,000 people in 2023 alone.  \nFlorida's new law restricts abortions after six weeks from the date of a woman's last menstrual period. \nPatients must also appear for two in-person appointments spaced at least 24-hours apart - a requirement that providers say will be a challenge in an already restrictive time window. \nThe new law \"makes it virtually impossible for people to be able to access care in time\", said Daniela Martins, a spokeswoman for the Women's Emergency Network (WEM), an abortion fund in south Florida.\nThe law includes limited exceptions for victims of rape, incest, or human trafficking up until 15 weeks of pregnancy, with patients required to show documentation such as medical records or a police report. It also includes exceptions for fatal foetal abnormalities and for the life of the pregnant person. \nAbortion providers and campaigners say that many patients will fall through the cracks - that they will either be unable to travel hundreds of miles to an appointment or unable find one in already overcrowded clinics in Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois, which are now some of the nearest states where abortion is broadly available. \n\"There's nowhere that can absorb all of the patients that we see [in Florida], it's just not possible,\" said Amber Gavin, vice-president of advocacy at A Woman's Choice, an independent abortion clinic with a location in Jacksonville.\nThe new law has been welcomed by anti-abortion activists and leading state Republicans, who had lamented Florida becoming a hub for out-of-state patients.\n\"We don't want to be an abortion tourism destination,\" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said last year. His office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nMr DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law last April, but it was held up by legal challenges until last month, when a state supreme court ruling cleared the way for its enforcement. \nMatt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel told the BBC that the state could now be \"a sanctuary for life\".\n\"This is a great day for protecting unborn children,\" he said. \nMr Staver emphasised that the six-week law also includes $30m (£24m) allocated each year to support pregnant women and new mothers, money that will go towards baby formula, car seats, adoption and parenting classes.\n\"Florida is putting its money where its mouth is and protecting mothers and their children,\" he said.  \nAccording to March of Dimes, a non-partisan maternal health non-profit, pregnant women in Florida \"have a very high vulnerability\" to poor outcomes, with nearly a quarter of all expectant mothers receiving \"inadequate\" prenatal care.  \nBut a second ruling from the Florida Supreme Court means the ban might be temporary. \nOn the same day as the court green-lit the six-week ban, it approved a ballot question that will ask voters whether to amend the state constitution to protect abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nSupporters of Amendment 4 have cited internal polls suggesting it has the backing of more than 60% of Florida's voters - the threshold required to for it to pass. \nAnd all seven abortion ballot initiatives held in other states in the months since Roe was overturned have been successful, though most required a lower threshold and passed by just a simple majority. \nBoth anti-abortion and pro-choice activists have launched sweeping get-out-the-vote efforts, hoping to round up enough support before the November vote. \n\"The next several months are going to be very critical,\" said Liberty Counsel's Mr Staver. \"Everything is on the line with this amendment, it's a fight for life.\" \nPro-choice campaigners have warned that, even if Amendment 4 is passed in November, there will still have been women forced to carry unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.\nMichelle Quesada, of Planned Parenthood, said it is likely some of the state's clinics also will be forced to close, pushing physicians out of the state. \n\"It just means less access and less options for Floridians,\" she said. \"This is devastating.\"",

        "content": "We could see the larger Chinese ship moving closer, both our ships going at high speed. The Chinese crew were close enough for us to see their faces.  Two of them filmed us, as we filmed them.The BBC was onboard the Philippines coast guard vessel BRP Bagacay when it was accosted by Chinese vessels on Tuesday.Filipino crews raced to hang yellow foam barriers over the side, preparing for a collision. Suddenly the Chinese ship made a sharp turn across our bow, forcing the Filipino captain to slow down abruptly. The two vessels were less than five metres apart.We were racing towards Scarborough Shoal, a tiny coral atoll 220km (137 miles) west of the Philippines coast, but also claimed by China.\nThe Chinese ships were determined to stop us, and there were a lot of them - at one point of time there were 10 of them from the coast guard and maritime militia. The Filipino captain relied on the speed and manoeuvrability of his Japanese-made ship to outrun the Chinese, and got to within 600m of the shoal, the closest yet, he told us.But there was a new barrier installed recently by the Chinese, just visible under the water. Their ships were right behind us, two positioning themselves on either side of the Filipino ship, at which point they began firing their powerful water cannon. We were rushed inside, from where we could hear the jets of water thundering against the metal walls of the ship. They smashed the awning in the stern, and mangled a railing on one side. The second ship in our convoy, carrying supplies for Filipino fishermen, was more badly damaged, after taking 10 direct hits from the water cannon.This game of maritime cat-and-mouse is nothing new in the South China Sea. But these encounters have become more frequent, and more serious, since President Bongbong Marcos authorised the coastguard to challenge the Chinese presence in disputed areas far more robustly than in the past.\n“The Chinese government has always said there is a red line”, said Commodore Jay Tarriela, the coast guard spokesman for the West Philippines Sea, the Filipino name for the areas it claims. “They said we could not cross the 12 nautical mile limit from the shoal. But under this administration we have already broken that red line, to show that China is not respecting international law.”The mission we were on is a part of that stronger response. Officially its goal was to supply food and fuel to the Filipino fishermen who have worked on Scarborough Shoal for decades, but who have complained of constant harassment since the Chinese coast guard took control of it in 2012.It was also to demonstrate the determination of the Philippines to press its claim to the shoal, which lies within the country’s legally-recognised exclusive economic zone, and is much close to the Philippines than to China.An international court ruling in 2016 said major elements of China’s claims in the South China Sea —such as its nine-dash line along with a number of activities in Philippine waters—were unlawful. China says it does not recognise the ruling.\nThe numbers of Chinese ships visible around the shoal were intimidating. We could see them in every direction, hugely outnumbering anything that the Philippines can deploy. “We are David to their Goliath,” said Commodore Tarriela.It is difficult to see where this new policy of President Marcos will lead, though he has been given strong backing by US President Joe Biden, and has scaled up a long-term modernisation programme for the armed forces.The Chinese ships were clearly skilled in their tactics, risky though they were. They can probably maintain their blockade almost indefinitely.After our encounter with their vessels, China put out a statement that it had successfully driven out the Filipino ships, which it accused of entering its territorial waters.It is true that the BRP Bagacay did pull back from Scarborough Shoal after being battered by water cannon from two sides. The second vessel, with the supplies and with much of its electronic equipment damaged, was still hemmed in by Chinese ships more 20km behind us, so our ship returned to assist it. \nBut both ships stayed at sea, outside China’s \"red line\" but still well within its infamous \"nine-dash line\", delineating its expansive claim to almost the entire South China Sea.By morning dozens of fishing boats were gathered around us to receive their aid. From a distance a Chinese coast guard ship kept watch. With what they see as China’s bullying tactics once again exposed, the Philippines coastguard views this mission as successfully accomplished.",

But that was kind of scary, it was a mental hurdle.\" \nBlunt may not get dropped from a great height but she also gets involved in the stunts; fighting villains and an alien (well, at least an actor dressed as an alien). \n\"Oh my God, she can turn anything into a deadly weapon, I'm glad you've removed the props. They don't call her Stuntie Bluntie for no reason,\" Gosling jokes. \nBlunt adds: \"Stuntie Bluntie is sort of the word on the street now, especially in the alien world.\"\nThe pair are split on who is the toughest: Gosling immediately says it is his co-star, joking that she was \"planking\" in a Pilates session the day before while everyone else was having a nap. \nBut Blunt says they are equally matched, telling Gosling: \"I wouldn't have done that fall you did at the beginning\". \nIt is obvious they get on well, both on screen and in person. \nAnd it turns out that may be down to Gosling's love of the British sense of humour. \n\"I find Ryan endlessly funny,\" Blunt says, \"I probably would not find him so funny if he wasn't as into British humour. He's a huge fan of The Office (the British version), he worships at the church of (Ricky) Gervais.\"\nBlunt and I praise his humour but Gosling suggests we're making fun of him, which we insist we're not (we're not).\n\"I'm kidding,\" he fires back. \"I've got the sarcasm.\"\nGosling may have been joking, but the stress I felt when I thought I had upset Ken was through the roof. \nSpeaking of Ken, I could not resist bringing up *that* I'm Just Ken performance at the Oscars. \nI tell Gosling I would find doing a song and dance routine on live television more terrifying than the stunts in the Fall Guy. \nHe laughs: \"Especially when you're performing for Emily Blunt who's looking at you and just going 'nope, thumbs down'.\n\"That is all he saw when he looked out, everyone else was in raptures and I was like 'ugh',\" Blunt replies, before quickly adding: \"No, I thought it was absolutely phenomenal.\"\n\"It was scary,\" Gosling admits, \"But my kids and Eva (Mendes, his partner) came to the dress rehearsal the day before, that was the real performance for me. That was the one I was most nervous about, so it was actually easy after that.\"\n\"They gave you some pointers,\" Blunt jokes. \nBlunt has her own musical performance in The Fall Guy, singing Against All Odds by Phil Collins. It's a far cry from her numerous numbers in Mary Poppins Returns.\nI ask if she fancies performing at next year's Academy Awards and she quickly replies: \"Oh God, no! \n\"That's what I said. Don't speak too soon,\" Gosling warns. \nGosling says he is keen to throw the spotlight on stunt performers as the unsung heroes of the film industry in his latest film.\n\"They dress like us, they do the dangerous things for us. They take the hits for us, they put themselves in harm's way for us.\" Gosling says, \"They play our characters as well, they're actors too, in the same union. But they hide their face and disappear into the shadows and everyone pretends they weren't there. \n\"The better they are at their job, the more they disappear in a way. It ends now. We're flipping the script.\"\nBoth stars believe the Oscars should recognise stuntmen and women. \"Immediately now! Why not before?\" Blunt exclaims.\nShe adds: \"They've trained for this, they have courage beyond words and I think because there is an innate humility with stunt performers, they don't feel the need to broadcast what they do. But I think it's time that we do.\" \n\"They risk more than anyone. Their work is an art form, it's designed just as much as make-up and costumes or anything else.\" Gosling says.\nThe film is one of the big blockbusters to be released this year and has had positive reviews so far. \nThe Independent calls it a \"Sweat-drenched spectacle that celebrates the harmonious union between heart-stopping stunt work and charismatic movie stars.\" The Independent calls it a \"Sweat-drenched spectacle that celebrates the harmonious union between heart-stopping stunt work and charismatic movie stars.\" \nIt adds that Gosling \"brings a little screwball energy to the role of seasoned stuntman Colt Seavers\".\n\"It's all a fizzy, funny, convincingly romantic delight, a tribute to the craft of making big movies with big stunts,\" says The Guardian.\"It's all a fizzy, funny, convincingly romantic delight, a tribute to the craft of making big movies with big stunts,\" says The Guardian.\nNew York Magazine says the film: \"Is an act of pure movie love, mixing and matching genres\".

She was born in Belgium and had spent most of her short life in Sweden.\nIn all, five people died in the same incident, victims of what must have felt like an agonising, slow-motion stampede.\nI'd been on the beach at the time with a BBC crew and had filmed the chaos as the smugglers, escorting their passengers across the beach towards a small boat, had used fireworks and wielded sticks to ward off a group of French police who'd attempted, and failed, to stop the group from boarding.I'd been on the beach at the time with a BBC crew and had filmed the chaos as the smugglers, escorting their passengers across the beach towards a small boat, had used fireworks and wielded sticks to ward off a group of French police who'd attempted, and failed, to stop the group from boarding.\n\"Help!\"\nAs the boat had drifted further out to sea, we'd heard someone shouting, faintly, from on board. But in the pre-dawn gloom it was impossible to tell what was happening. As dawn broke, the police were already moving away from the shore along with one suspected smuggler and some of the migrants who had failed to clamber aboard. \nAhmed later confirmed that the man shouting for help was him, desperately imploring those around him to save Sara's life. Ahmed's wife, Nour AlSaeed, and their two other children, 13-year-old Rahaf and eight-year-old Hussam, were also trapped in the boat, but still able to breathe.\n\"I'm a construction worker. I'm strong. But I couldn't pull my leg out. No wonder my little girl couldn't either. She was under our feet,\" said Ahmed.\nThis had been the family's fourth attempt at a crossing since they'd arrived in the area two months earlier. Twice the police had caught them on the beach as they'd struggled to keep up with the other migrants sprinting towards a smuggler's boat. Ahmed said this time the smugglers - who charged 1,500 euros (£1,280) per adult, and half that for each child - had promised him that only 40 people, mostly Iraqis, would get on their boat, but that they'd been surprised when a separate group of Sudanese migrants had appeared on the beach and insisted on piling aboard.\nSara had been calm at first, holding her father's hand as they'd walked from the train station in Wimereux the evening before. They had then hidden in the dunes north of town overnight. Sometime before 0600, the group had inflated their boat and then the smugglers had ordered them to carry it down on to the beach and run with it towards the sea before the police intercepted them.\nSuddenly, Ahmed said, a police tear gas canister had exploded near them, and Sara had begun screaming. Once they'd clambered on to the boat, Ahmed had kept Sara on his shoulders for a minute or so but had then taken her down in order to help his other daughter, Rahaf, to get on board, which is when he lost sight of Sara.\nIt was only later, when French rescuers reached them out at sea and offloaded some of the more than 100 people crammed on the boat, that Ahmed was finally able to reach his daughter's body.\n\"I saw her head in the corner of the boat. She was all blue. She was dead when we pulled her out. She wasn't breathing,\" he explained, between sobs.\nIn the days since then, the family have been looked after by the French authorities, while they wait to bury Sara's body. Ahmed said he was aware that he's faced strong criticism on social media from people accusing him of putting his family at unnecessary risk. He appears torn between accepting and rejecting such blame.\n\"I will never forgive myself. But the sea was the only choice I had. Everything that happened was against my will. I ran out of options. People blame me and say, 'How could I risk my daughters?' But I've spent 14 years in Europe and have been rejected,\" said Ahmed, detailing years of failed attempts to secure residency in the EU after he'd fled Iraq following what he described as threats from militia groups there. \nBelgium reportedly denied him asylum by arguing that Basra, his hometown in Iraq, was classified as a safe area. He said his children spent the last seven years staying with a relative in Sweden, but that he was recently informed that they would be deported, with him, to Iraq.\n\"If I knew there was a 1% chance that I could keep the kids in Belgium or France or Sweden or Finland I would keep them there. All I wanted was for my kids to go to school. I didn't want any assistance. My wife and I can work. I just wanted to protect them and their childhoods and their dignity,\" he continued.\n\"If people were in my place, what would they do? Those who (criticise me) haven't suffered what I've suffered. This was my last option,\" he said, appealing to the British government for sympathy and support.\nEva Jonsson, Sara's teacher in Uddevalla, Sweden, described the seven-year-old as \"kind and nice\", in a video message sent to the BBC. \n\"She had a lot of friends in the school. They played together all the time… In February we heard she would be deported and that it would happen quickly. We had two days' notice,\" she said.\nAfter learning of her death, the class gathered in a circle and held a minute's silence.\n\"It's very unfortunate that it happens to such a nice family. I have taught [other] children in that family, and I was really shocked about the deportation,\" said the teacher. \n\"We have Sara's picture in front of us still, and we will keep it there as long as the children want.\"",

        "content": "Riot police in Georgia have fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse crowds protesting against a bill seen by the opposition as targeting media freedoms.\nPro-EU protesters clashed with police outside parliament, denouncing what they see as a Russian-inspired law.\nDozens of people were arrested and an opposition party leader was hurt.\nGeorgian MPs have given their initial backing to the \"foreign agent\" bill, despite the EU warning that it could harm Tbilisi's bid to join the bloc.\nParliament is expected to hold a second vote on the bill on Wednesday.\nGeorgia was granted EU candidate status last December and polls suggest about 80% of the population is in favour of joining. \nProtests against the bill began in mid-April, after the ruling Georgian Dream party proposed measures requiring non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and independent media to register as organisations \"bearing the interests of a foreign power\", if they receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors.\nThey would also be monitored by Georgia's justice ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 Georgian lari ($9,400; £7,500).\nOpponents say the measures are inspired by authoritarian legislation that neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. But the billionaire founder of the Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, claims a Western \"global war\" party is using the country as part of its confrontation with Russia.\nSeveral protesters were injured during the clashes on Rustaveli Avenue, outside parliament in Tbilisi, on Tuesday night.\nAmong them, according to Georgian media, was Levan Khabeishvili, chairman of the main opposition party United National Movement (UNM). He posted a picture of his bruised face on social media.\nEyewitnesses accused some police officers of physically attacking protesters. Interior ministry officials said six officers were hurt and 63 people arrested.\nProtesters fear that the proposed foreign influence bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of the parliamentary elections later this year. \nA similar authoritarian law that came into force in Russia in 2012 has since used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups.\nMany Georgians fear the measures will derail Georgia from its path towards the much-coveted status of EU membership, says the BBC's South Caucasus correspondent, Rayhan Demytrie.\nA number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is \"incompatible\" with European norms and values.\nBut the government of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. \nMr Kobakhidze has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting \"gay propaganda\" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. \nThe government insists the bill is about ensuring transparency and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. \nOn Monday, Bidzina Ivanishvili told a rally of Georgian Dream supporters that foreign-funded NGOs threatened Georgian sovereignty and that the opposition UNM would be punished for crimes against the state after this year's elections.\nGeorgia's ceremonial president, Salome Zourabichvili, described the pro-government rally as a \"Putin-type\" event.\nMs Zourabichvili, who is strongly opposed to the foreign influence bill, has appealed to the interior ministry to stop using \"disproportionate force\" against protesters.",

The heat that we are experiencing, it could steadily increase in the coming days,\" Mr Estareja said.\nThe Philippines is in the middle of its warm and dry season, which is exacerbated by El Nino or the unusual warming of surface waters in the Pacific Ocean. The archipelago nation's entire east coast faces the Pacific.\nThe South East Asian nation is one of the most at risk countries in the world from the effects of climate change. Its wet season can bring about monster storms,  like Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, one of the most powerful in history.\n\"We are seeing that our dam levels will drop, including in Pantabangan and other areas,\" Mr Estareja said.\nThe water level there has fallen by nearly 50m from its normal high level of 221m, based on official data.\nThe ruins began to resurface in March as the area had been receiving almost no rain, Mr Paladin told AFP. The re-emergence of the ruins have drawn tourists to the town, some 202km (125 miles) north of the capital, Manila.\nAside from the Philippines, Bangladesh has also enforced class suspensions that have affected 33 million students.Aside from the Philippines, Bangladesh has also enforced class suspensions that have affected 33 million students.\nIn Thailand, 30 people have died of heatstroke between January and April 17 this year, compared with 37 in the whole of 2023, the health ministry said.

He was arrested in 2013, at the age of 15, and given a juvenile non-custodial two-year suspended sentence.He was arrested in 2013, at the age of 15, and given a juvenile non-custodial two-year suspended sentence.At the time, cyber experts were worried his punishment would fail to deter him - and he was quickly linked to many more hacks carried out with teen gangs before disappearing for years.His name was quickly linked to the Vastaamo hack of 2020 after experts pointed to  Kivimäki traits in the attack. He demanded a 400,000 Euro (£340,000) ransom from the company.When it refused, he emailed thousands of patients asking for 200 Euros and threatening to publish their notes and personal details on the darknet which he did anyway in full.But it was a mistake that the hacker made himself that led police to a treasure trove of information found on a server that Kivimäki owned. Unprecedented digital forensics and cryptocurrency tracking also helped secure the conviction.\nTiina Parikka recalls receiving the email from him saying that he had her therapy notes. She told the BBC it caused her to relapse into mental health problems that the therapy had initially helped her overcome.“So many people were affected by this in so many ways,\" she said.The boss of Vastaamo, Ville Tapio, was also convicted of failing to protect his customers' sensitive data. Investigations found that the databases were vulnerable and open to the internet without proper protections. He was given a suspended three-month prison sentence last year.The company which was once a highly regarded and successful business in Finland collapsed after the hack.Despite the conviction, the Vastaamo case is not over as civil court cases are now likely to begin in an attempt to get some of the victims compensation for the hack.",

        "content": "Spiralling tensions and cross-border strikes which have killed more than 70 civilians in Lebanon have turned parts of the south into ghost towns. Residents have fled, leaving their homes at risk of destruction. The BBC went on patrol with the UN's peacekeeping force there to see what has happened.\nThe huge crater containing a mangled mattress buried under a pile of dust and stone is all that's left of the building that stood on this spot just days ago. \n\"We call it 'the pool',\" said a Lebanese army officer at Yarine - a border town on the front line of the one of the region's most dangerous conflict zones.\nYarine is just 1km (0.6 miles) from the UN-designated Blue Line - the highly volatile, unofficial boundary between Israel and Lebanon.\nIn every town near the line, there are similar sights: buildings levelled or vanished into craters; next to them, buildings which have been damaged, then rows of houses intact - followed by more craters. \nIn Alma el Shaab, about 4km west of Yarine, stand the remains of what appears to have been a gated villa with parked cars - destroyed, apart from a fence now surrounding a pile of rubble. The windows of houses nearby were all smashed from the force of the explosions. \n\"We are paying the price of all of this,\" lamented the 75-year-old owner of the villa, Nadim Sayyah. \nMr Sayyah said he used to keep the lights on all the time in the hope that might spare the family home from being hit.\n\"Everything is lost, the house, the belongings, and the cars. But I will return as soon as I can, even if I were to live in a tent there.\"\nA soldier there pointed out that \"one missile did all of this\".\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes on southern Lebanon almost daily since Hezbollah - the powerful Lebanese Shia Islamist group - fired rockets at Israel on 8 October in support of Hamas in Gaza, triggering an escalating series of attacks and counter-attacks.\nBecause of the danger - three reporters (one from Reuters and two from Al Mayadeen) have been killed in strikes in south Lebanon which their news organisations and Lebanon have blamed on Israel - the BBC team visited the border area with the UN peacekeeping force, Unifil. Israel has said it does not target journalists.\nUnifil has been in south Lebanon since Israel's pullback and eventual withdrawal following its invasion of 1978.\nIn a not-too-distant past, Unifil proudly emphasised that it had overseen the longest period of calm between Lebanon and Israel - stretching to 16 years since the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.\nAs the BBC team was filming, what seemed to be Israeli drones could be heard in the sky. Moments later, plumes of thick black smoke appeared in the distance, an apparent Israeli strike. It was not possible to know what had been hit. \nThe Israeli army says it targets Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure and retaliates to attacks on Israeli army bases in northern Israel. \nBut some Lebanese officials, including the caretaker prime minster and Speaker of Parliament, have accused it of implementing scorched earth tactics to make the whole area uninhabitable.\nRight now, there is no sign of life in many southern villages. People have fled, leaving towns deserted. About 90,000 Lebanese have become displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). On the Israeli side, about 80,000 people have been evacuated. \nIsrael's defence minister has said Israelis from northern communities cannot expect to return home until Hezbollah has been driven back from the border.\nThe Lebanese town of Aita el Shaab - just 700m (2,300ft) from Israel - has suffered the heaviest damage so far. On the day of our visit, Israel said it launched 40 strikes on the town.\n\"We know that our house has been badly damaged, but it is still standing - as far as we know,\" said Hussein Jawad, who comes from Aita el Shaab. \nHussein, a construction worker, left his house with his seven children and his wife in October. They are now staying in an apartment on the outskirts of Beirut. \n\"We didn't expect it all to last that long. We thought it would just be a couple of days,\" his wife Maryam said. \"We know it will still take a while.\"\nWe showed Hussein a video of his town that we filmed just months ago. \n\"This house is now destroyed, that one doesn't exist any more, this row of shops here is now totally flattened,\" he pointed out.\nHe has ventured back to his town once - weeks ago when he attended a funeral. He gets updates about his house every once in a while, from the civil defence staff there or from the mayor who has not left the town.  \nAccording to the US-based monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (Acled), there have been more than 5,400 cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah since October. It says 80% of those were carried out by Israel.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said last month that it had hit over 4,300 \"Hezbollah targets\". It has also said that as of 2 April, approximately 3,100 rockets had been fired at Israel from Lebanese territory. Israel says nine civilians have been killed by rocket-fire from Lebanon.\nHussein does not expect to be able to move back home any time soon.\n\"It could be that what we are witnessing is just the beginning of it,\" he says. \nBack on the road with the Italian contingent on Unifil, its commander, Colonel Alberto Salvador, insists that the peacekeeping forces' role is still very important, despite the continuing violence. \n\"We see many people are tired of the situation on this side of the border and on the other side as well. I think it's time for peace,\" he says. \n\"The next challenge for the Unifil is to help and support the local population in returning to their homes.\"\nBut as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies, the prospect of that happening remains dim.",

        "content": "Everything feels sodden in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and beyond.\nIt seems as if the rain has been falling without respite for six weeks, and the impact has been devastating. \nSo far more than 120 people have lost their lives, including at least 50 in a deluge on Monday in an area about 60km (37 miles) from Nairobi.\nThis is the wet season, but there has been far more rainfall than what is normally expected, which has been put down to the El Niño weather phenomenon.This is the wet season, but there has been far more rainfall than what is normally expected, which has been put down to the El Niño weather phenomenon.\nRivers and sewers have overflowed, roads have become waterways and homes have been destroyed.\nFlooding in Nairobi is not unusual but the sheer scale of this year's deluge has exposed longer term problems with the way the city has developed.\n\"You can't contain nature. It doesn't work like that,\" Prof Alfred Omenya, an urban planning and environment expert, told the BBC.\nHe says that much of the city sits on top the Nairobi River's floodplain, which cuts through the capital. A number of other rivers and streams also flow through Nairobi.\nA properly developed drainage system may have been able to cope, but as the city has grown over the last century from 100,000 residents to today's 4.5 million the infrastructure has not kept up.\nCompounding the problem is that less than half of the residents are connected to a sewage system. In slum areas, open sewers are common, which overflow when it floods.\nDrains have also become blocked as people dispose of their household rubbish.\nOpen spaces have disappeared as more and more buildings have gone up - both in slums and planned areas. \nAs more concrete covers the earth there are fewer places to absorb the water, and it runs off - overwhelming the drains and rivers.\nAs a result the roads have become part of the drainage system, Prof Omenya said.\nHe blames \"clueless leadership that started from the colonial times\".\nUnplanned settlements have been allowed to develop around the rivers, sometimes disrupting their natural flow.\nMany of the slum areas in the city, such as Mukuru and Mathare, have been built on marginal land along river valleys. \nLast Wednesday, the authorities retrieved a dozen bodies of people who had drowned in the Mathare river following heavy rains the previous evening.\nIn the aftermath of the downpour, most of the houses in the area were flooded, with some residents trapped on the roofs of their houses.\nUpmarket estates were also hit, including some that have not been prone to flooding in the past.\nThe man who runs the city, Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja, said the rainfall levels have been very high, and blamed the encroachment on the land surrounding the rivers for the flooding crisis.\nThe governor has now suspended approvals for building developments and excavations.\nBut the bigger task might be clearing or improving the slum areas. \nThe government does have a plan to build affordable and decent housing, but past upgrading projects have not met the burgeoning demand. \nIn the meantime, residents have been asked to move to higher ground for their own safety.   \nPresident William Ruto has said that people living in dangerous areas around the country will be moved to land provided by the National Youth Service, while the government plans a long-term solution.\nHe said the military and the national government had been mobilised to work with counties to support those in distress.\nNeighbouring Kiambu county, parts of which are on a river basin and have been affected by the floods, has also announced it will take measures to mitigate the situation, including building inspections. \nIn the past, buildings in and around the city have been demolished as a way to address irregular developments - but often with little effect.\nSome of developments in the city and its environs have been criticised for impeding the flow of water, which then finds its way to other areas.  \nConstruction of buildings on wetlands has also been a big problem. \nIn 2018, the multimillion-dollar South End Mall in Langata and the Ukay Mall in Westlands were demolished as part of a campaign to reclaim wetlands. \n\"Now we have many homes built next to rivers so flooded. Walls have collapsed all over… Don't go against nature. It will fight back,\" Robert Alai, a Nairobi county assembly legislator wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nBefore the most recent floods, Mr Sakaja had defended the development of high-rise buildings in some residential areas, saying the only way Nairobi would develop was to build up.  \nHis stance had come amid criticism that the developments were straining an already overwhelmed infrastructure. He has now issued a directive stopping all building development approvals \"until we can review all those that have been issued and are continuing in the city\".\nA number of MPs also criticised the governor over city management, citing the sewage and flooding crisis. \nMr Sakaja has defended himself, saying the criticism was politically motivated.\nOutspoken Senator Samson Cherargei from the ruling coalition said the governor was not to blame as \"the problem we are having begun in 1963, you cannot resolve it now\".\nSome of the problems can be traced back to the origins of Nairobi - meaning a \"place of cool waters\" in the Maasai language - and the fact that it was not considered a suitable place for large numbers of people to live in.\nIt started as a railway depot under the British colonial authorities in the late 1890s. The engineers who worked on the site called the area a \"swamp\", with soggy land and \"unsanitary conditions\".\nYears later, colonial official Sir Charles Eliot said Nairobi sat in \"a depression with a very thin layer of soil or rock. The soil was water-logged during the greater part of the year\".\nNevertheless, the city developed into an attractive city with good weather, a lot of greenery and a national park.\nBut its drainage problem has persisted. \nAn initial masterplan by the colonial authorities took into consideration the lay of the land and designed measures to prevent disasters. There have been at least two other blueprints post-independence to date - but they have mostly not been implemented.\nThis season's floods show that as rainfall could get more intense as a result of climate change a new plan is urgently needed, Prof Omenya said.\nBut the ordinary city-dweller is left mopping up, hoping that the rains subside.",

At a press conference following the announcement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said he thought that a rate increase was \"unlikely\", while repeating that officials wanted greater confidence that inflation was easing before moving to cut. \"It really will depend on the data,\" he said. \"It's going to take longer to reach that point of comfort. I don't know how long it will take,\" he added. In the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March.That is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. In its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting \"a lack of further progress\" bringing inflation back to its goal.\"The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\"Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing.\" The Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022.Higher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt.The Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. Mr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown.\"The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,\" he said. \"We can be patient.\"Separately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries.It built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. Mr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",

The gig felt like \"a massive step up”.\nAt that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop.At that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop.But one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules, and her career changed overnight.But one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules, and her career changed overnight.A number one in the UK, and her first hit in the US, the song's message of female solidarity propelled her into main pop-girl territory, after years of hustling behind the scenes.\nThe song clocked up its three-billionth play on YouTube this January – just as Dua started ramping up the campaign for her highly anticipated third album, Radical Optimism.It’s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns.It’s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns.“Before, I would see a red flag and be like, ‘Oh, how beautiful’,” she laughs.“It could be anything: One sly, demeaning comment that you brush off… and then you realise it's a pattern.“I’ve learned to not kid myself.”\nThose lessons permeate the album’s punchy, keyed-up dance anthems. On the singles Training Season and Houdini, she vets prospective partners, and shows the door to anyone who falls below her standards.The lyrics were inspired by a string of bad dates she endured after coming out of a two-year relationship with Anwar Hadid (brother of Bella and Gigi Hadid).But how does dating work for someone at Dua Lipa’s level of fame? Are people intimidated to ask her out?“I don't know if people feel free to approach me,” Dua muses. “Maybe?“Dating apps, for me, I don't think would work. They might think they’re being catfished.“I like to go on a friend’s recommendation. It makes it easier when they're vetted.\"\nWhen a match is made, her expectations for a first date are charmingly unstarry.“I like a walk in the park,\" she says. \"You can chat and walk and get to know someone. No frills. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy.“Having a good conversation is the best thing. That's how you see if you gel, if there's a spark.”For now, at least, that's not a concern. Dua has been in a relationship with British actor Callum Turner since the beginning of the year.And her personal life will have to take a back seat as she gears up for a busy summer.\nRadical Optimism is released on Friday, with Dua hosting and singing on Saturday Night Live a day later (the last British artist invited to do that was Harry Styles).In addition, she’s got her podcast series, the weekly arts and culture newsletter Service95, and an upcoming Disney documentary series about Camden’s music scene, which she executive produced.But looming over everything is Dua’s return to Glastonbury. This time on the Pyramid Stage.“I think about it all the time,” she says.“Fifty per cent of my thoughts go to Glastonbury, then the rest are for everyday tasks.”Her journey to the top of the bill is a story of aspiration, setbacks and tenacity that goes right back to childhood.\nDua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars.Dua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars.A natural performer, Dua’s enthusiasm was thwarted by her primary school music teacher, who put her through a humiliating public audition in front of the whole school.“He started playing the piano and I’m trying to hit this high note, and nothing comes out. Literally just air,” she recalls.“Everyone in assembly laughed. I was so embarrassed. It was a big moment for me in my life.”\nSalvation came at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where the young Dua Lipa enrolled as a weekend student.There, she was taken under the wing of singing tutor Ray Lamb. Recognising that her voice skewed towards the lower end of the mezzo-soprano range, he instantly removed her from the junior choir and put her in with the teens.She was “mortified” to be singing next to children who were twice her height, but says Ray “helped me build my confidence”.“He was the toughest one, the scariest one, but really soft, deep down. And when he told you that you were good, you had a real sense of validation. He was the teacher that really made me feel I had something.”\nDua Lipa: Headlining GlastonburyWatch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BBC iPlayer (UK only).Watch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BBC iPlayer (UK only).\nEncouraged, she started posting cover songs to YouTube (“I thought I’d get discovered like Justin Bieber”) until, all of a sudden, her parents decided to move back to Kosovo.Dua stuck it out for two years before persuading the family she should return to London. There, she shared a flat with a family friend, taking jobs in retail and modelling to pay her rent, while “trying to get school over with as quickly as possible”.Her first demos were released in 2012. A year later, after appearing in an X Factor commercial, she signed with Lana Del Rey's manager, Ben Mawson, who sent her for two years of intensive writing sessions.Her first demos were released in 2012. A year later, after appearing in an X Factor commercial, she signed with Lana Del Rey's manager, Ben Mawson, who sent her for two years of intensive writing sessions.The results included early singles like Be The One and Hotter Than Hell; but it took a while for Dua to climb the rocky peaks of pop. Her debut album was delayed three times before New Rules lit a rocket underneath her career.\nSuddenly, she was learning her job in the full glare of the spotlight. Some of her early TV performances lacked polish, as the singer got used to juggling live vocals with camera angles and choreography. A stilted performance at a German festival spawned the \"go girl, give us nothing\" meme, which still stings to this day.\"It made me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough or I didn't deserve to be there, I wasn't cut out to be a musician. \" she told America’s National Public Radio in 2022.\"It made me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough or I didn't deserve to be there, I wasn't cut out to be a musician. \" she told America’s National Public Radio in 2022.These days, those early wobbles are a distant memory.Dua opened both the 2024 Grammy and the Brit Awards, with high-concept, acrobatic dance numbers that could have been lifted straight from a movie musical.Creating those performances counts as “some of the most rewarding work I have done with an artist in my career”, says her long-time choreographer Charm La’Donna.“I really admire Dua's work ethic and the grit she has to keep challenging herself as a performer. We have such a good time creating together that at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like work.\"\nDua says the title of her new album, Radical Optimism, is partly a reference to the uncertainty of her early days.“I thought it was so important, the idea of pushing through when things feel like they aren't going well. Because often, with hindsight, you can say, ‘This thing that really upset me, I can see from a different perspective now’.”It’s a mindset she brought to the album. Writing sessions actually began in 2021, as a way of staying productive when the pandemic put her Future Nostalgia tour on hold.“I knew the title that early,” she says. “I felt like I had to write myself into a good idea.”However, the early sessions were fruitless. The new sound she was searching for didn’t materialise until she finally hit the road in 2022.The thrill of playing her music with a live band inspired her to take the same approach in the studio. Programmed beats and loops were replaced by live drums, flamenco guitar and even, on a song called Maria, the sound of a Polynesian nose flute.She calls it “alternative but pop, with a touch of psychedelia”. \nFans will hear 11 tight, summer holiday-ready pop bangers - and the ones who pay attention to the lyrics will notice a big shift in Dua’s perspective.Her first album was full of screw-you anthems, aimed at a cheating boyfriend. But the final song on Radical Optimism, Happy For You, finds her wishing an ex good luck with his new partner.“Even the hard parts were all for the best,” she sings over a swirling piano motif. “I must have loved you more than I ever knew.\"“Even the hard parts were all for the best,” she sings over a swirling piano motif. “I must have loved you more than I ever knew.\"“That’s definitely a new emotion,” says the star. “\"I used to be much more impulsive and reactive [but] not every break-up has to be a bad one.”Her writing feels more specific on this album. On Watcha Doing, Dua admits the damage her need for control causes in relationships; while These Walls is a Polaroid picture of a couple realising their time is up, that reaches Abba levels of domestic misery.It’s a corrective to critics who’ve sometimes described Dua’s work as anonymous or faceless.“As a pop artist, there's always the stigma of not being taken seriously,” she says. “Pop music makes you feel good, so it can't be deep, or honest, or real.“But it's a challenge I'm willing to take on: Putting the meaning back into pop.”\nIt’s notable that Dua’s album arrives within weeks of headline releases by Ariana Grande, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, with new material from Billie Eilish due in May.In the past, they’d have been pitted against each other by a press hungry for drama.But not this time.“We’re definitely growing up,” says Dua. “People are being held accountable for the way they choose to portray women.”Setting up false rivalries “creates friction” and adds “pressure to a relationship that’s not yet fully formed”, she argues. That stifles artists’ ability to collaborate and support one another, and she’s thankful a corner has been turned.“We’re in a moment in time where there’s so much camaraderie and I think it’s working in our favour,” she says.“It’s amazing to see so many women putting out albums at the same time. And everyone is so different, with such different stories to tell, so why isn’t there room for everyone?”\nGlastonbury proves that there is. For the first time ever, the festival will have two female headliners – with Dua joined by US R&B phenomenon SZA.“I feel so lucky to be a part of that shift,” says Dua. “It’s important to have more female headliners. We’ve just got to keep applying the pressure and making that change happen.”The booking is effectively a coronation for the new queen of British pop – and Dua is determined to make it count.She casts her mind back to her first tour, when she’d invite the audience on stage for the encore of Blow Your Mind (Mwah), and wonders how that would work on the Pyramid Stage.“It might be tight,” she laughs. “But I’ve got to figure out a way to make 150,000 people feel like they’re in a small little nightclub.“That’s the goal, and if there’s one place to do it, it’s gotta be Glasto.”Let’s just hope she takes care of her tailbone this time.",

        "content": "Over 300 pro-Palestinian protesters at New York City university campuses were arrested Tuesday night after hundreds of police officers raided a building the students had taken over. \nDramatic footage showed police climbing a ladder to enter Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied at Columbia University, and later removing people handcuffed with zip ties. \nThe university had earlier told any students involved to leave or face expulsion.\nOfficials have said the building was cleared and no injuries were reported.\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) said on Wednesday that nearly 300 people in total were arrested - including 119 at Columbia University and 173 from the nearby City College of New York - on charges of trespassing, criminal mischief and burglary.\nThe NYPD is still working to decipher who was affiliated with the university out of those who were arrested. \nAt Wednesday's news conference, New York Mayor Eric Adams said students had a \"right to protest\". \nBut he added: \"There's nothing peaceful about barricading buildings, destroying property or dismantling security cameras.\"\nThe demonstrators want the university to divest from Israel over its continuing deadly military operation in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Columbia protest is one of dozens across the country, including at campuses in Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, New Mexico, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana, where police have arrested more than 1,000 protesters.\nThe Columbia arrests came just before violence erupted over the war in Gaza at another campus hundreds of miles away on the West Coast. \nLengthy clashes broke out early Wednesday morning between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California in Los Angeles, after school administrators moved to shut down an encampment it called \"unlawful\". \nCounter-demonstrators clad in black arrived at the campus around midnight local time, before trying to tear down barricades around the encampment, the LA Times reported. Video footage showed flares and fireworks being set off, while other clips showed scuffles between the groups. \nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the scenes \"abhorrent and inexcusable\" and said police officers had arrived at the campus. \nIn New York, meanwhile, school officials authorised police officers to enter Hamilton Hall at Columbia University after student demonstrators inside defied a deadline to disperse. One student told the BBC that around 80-100 police stormed the building. \nColumbia said that after the hall was \"occupied, vandalised and blockaded, we were left with no choice\". In a letter to the New York Police Department (NYPD), President Minouche Shafik wrote that she requested police aid \"with the utmost regret\". \nOfficers said they used flashbang grenades to \"disorient protesters\" as the raid commenced, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \nSome students could be heard shouting \"Shame on you!\" at the officers as they entered the building around 21:30 EST. \nNYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said those in the building tried to lock the police out, but officials were still able to gain access. \nSome students alleged that police clad in riot gear manhandled demonstrators as they stormed the building, with one telling the BBC that three people had been pushed down the stairs by NYPD officers. The interview was cut short moments later after an officer interrupted and slammed shut a window through which the conversation had been happening. \nNYPD assistant commissioner of public information, Carlos Nieves, defended the officers. He said that students had \"barricaded\" the doors to Hamilton Hall with \"conference tables, chairs or soda machines\". He alleged they had also blocked windows with newspaper so officers \"couldn't see\". \nHuge cheers of support by anti-war crowds were heard as the arrested students were marched off with their hands in zip ties. People also chanted: \"Let them go!\"\nThe activists have been occupying a tent camp at the Ivy League school in upper Manhattan for nearly two weeks.\nAll was relatively quiet on Columbia's campus on Wednesday as non-essential visitors are not allowed to enter. Some Columbia students could be seen packing up their possessions with the help of their parents. \nThe school has gone fully remote, and it will retain NYPD officers on campus until 17 May. \nNational politicians have called on colleges to do more, highlighting reports of antisemitism at some of the demonstrations.\nPresident Joe Biden earlier said demonstrations should be peaceful, but \"forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful - it is wrong\".\nHis Democratic colleague, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, condemned the police response at Columbia and urged Mayor Eric Adams to find a \"de-escalatory path\". \n\"This is the opposite of leadership and endangers public safety,\" she wrote. \"A nightmare in the making. I urge the mayor to reverse course.\"\nAnother New York Democrat, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, attacked what he called \"the militarisation of college campuses\" by police. ",

        "content": "Florida's six-week abortion ban has come into force, closing the door - for now - on the last major abortion access point in the US South. \nAnti-abortion campaigners have celebrated the new legislation - which replaces an existing 15-week law - as the gold standard of abortion policy and a major victory in the country's battle over abortion access. \nBut pro-choice campaigners say the ban will push an overstretched system to the brink. \nThey worry the new law in Florida, which had been the last state in the region without a near-total ban, will effectively cut off abortion access for more than 21 million women of reproductive age across nearly a dozen states.\n\"This essentially creates an abortion desert in the south-east part of our country,\" said Michelle Quesada, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. \"This will be devastating.\" \nAnd, activists say, the near-total ban will put women's health at risk, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states like Texas. And, activists say, the near-total ban will put women's health at risk, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states like Texas. \nBut the change may be undone as soon as November, when Floridians will vote on a ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which could protect abortion access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nBoth the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.Both the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.\nAfter that landmark ruling in June 2022, most Republican-controlled states moved to restrict abortion outright or at six weeks gestation, a point at which many women do not yet know they are pregnant. \nFlorida was an outlier. \nAbortion there was legal until 15 weeks, making it a relative haven for women seeking the procedure in the region. \nAfter Roe v Wade was overturned, Florida became \"one of the main points of access for abortion care within the formal healthcare system in the south\", said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute.\nMore than 84,000 abortions took place in Florida last year - a 12% jump from 2020.\nMore than half of that increase is attributed to out-of-state patients, Mr Maddow-Zimmet said, an estimated 9,000 people in 2023 alone.  \nFlorida's new law restricts abortions after six weeks from the date of a woman's last menstrual period. \nPatients must also appear for two in-person appointments spaced at least 24-hours apart - a requirement that providers say will be a challenge in an already restrictive time window. \nThe new law \"makes it virtually impossible for people to be able to access care in time\", said Daniela Martins, a spokeswoman for the Women's Emergency Network (WEM), an abortion fund in south Florida.\nThe law includes limited exceptions for victims of rape, incest, or human trafficking up until 15 weeks of pregnancy, with patients required to show documentation such as medical records or a police report. It also includes exceptions for fatal foetal abnormalities and for the life of the mother.\nAbortion providers and campaigners say that many patients will fall through the cracks - that they will either be unable to travel hundreds of miles to an appointment or unable find one in already overcrowded clinics in Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois, which are now some of the nearest states where abortion is broadly available. \n\"There's nowhere that can absorb all of the patients that we see [in Florida], it's just not possible,\" said Amber Gavin, vice-president of advocacy at A Woman's Choice, an independent abortion clinic with a location in Jacksonville.\nThe new law has been welcomed by anti-abortion activists and leading state Republicans, who had lamented Florida becoming a hub for out-of-state patients.\n\"We don't want to be an abortion tourism destination,\" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said last year. His office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nMr DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law last April, but it was held up by legal challenges until last month, when a state supreme court ruling cleared the way for its enforcement. \nMatt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel told the BBC that the state could now be \"a sanctuary for life\".\n\"This is a great day for protecting unborn children,\" he said. \nMr Staver emphasised that the six-week law also includes $30m (£24m) allocated each year to support pregnant women and new mothers, money that will go towards baby formula, car seats, adoption and parenting classes.\n\"Florida is putting its money where its mouth is and protecting mothers and their children,\" he said.  \nAccording to March of Dimes, a non-partisan maternal health non-profit, pregnant women in Florida \"have a very high vulnerability\" to poor outcomes, with nearly a quarter of all expectant mothers receiving \"inadequate\" prenatal care.  \nBut a second ruling from the Florida Supreme Court means the ban might be temporary. \nOn the same day as the court green-lit the six-week ban, it approved a ballot question that will ask voters whether to amend the state constitution to protect abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nSupporters of Amendment 4 have cited internal polls suggesting it has the backing of more than 60% of Florida's voters - the threshold required to for it to pass. \nAnd all seven abortion ballot initiatives held in other states in the months since Roe was overturned have been successful, though most required a lower threshold and passed by just a simple majority. \nBoth anti-abortion and pro-choice activists have launched sweeping get-out-the-vote efforts, hoping to round up enough support before the November vote. \n\"The next several months are going to be very critical,\" said Liberty Counsel's Mr Staver. \"Everything is on the line with this amendment, it's a fight for life.\" \nPro-choice campaigners have warned that, even if Amendment 4 is passed in November, there will still have been women forced to carry unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.\nMichelle Quesada, of Planned Parenthood, said it is likely some of the state's clinics also will be forced to close, pushing physicians out of the state. \n\"It just means less access and less options for Floridians,\" she said. \"This is devastating.\"",

        "content": "The union for senior civil servants is launching an unprecedented legal challenge to ministers' Rwanda plan. \nThe FDA said it was intervening because it feared the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda could force officials to break the law.  \nUnder a new law, ministers can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and direct officials to organise flights. \nThe union wants the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position. \nThe FDA fears civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law, would put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code. \nThe government said advice from Darren Tierney, its head of propriety and ethics, says the code would not be breached. \nIn a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.In a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.\n\"They would be operating in compliance with the law, which is the law enacted by Parliament under which the minister's specifically recognised and confirmed discretion would be exercised.\" \nThe Rwanda plan is the key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies. \nThe Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.The Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.\nIt also limits what kind of legal challenges they can present to the courts and, crucially, says ministers could choose to ignore a temporary order from the European Court of Human Rights to halt flights while a case is still being considered. \nIn practice, that would see ministers ordering key civil service leaders to prepare and send off flights, even if judges have said the case has not been settled. \nThe First Division Association (FDA), which represents those Whitehall leaders, said that measure means members fear they could be ordered to break both international law and the Civil Service Code, their legally-underpinned rule book.\nDave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said its members were not taking a political view on whether the Rwanda plan was right or wrong - but they needed certainty about whether the measure places them in a conflict between ministers and the law.\n\"This [measure] is not an accident or down to poor drafting,\" he said.\n\"It's a political choice from the government, made not for the good of the country but to avoid upsetting either of the warring factions within its own party.\"\n\"It's also irresponsible. Civil servants know that they have to support the government of the day and implement policy, regardless of their political beliefs, but they also know they have a legal obligation to adhere to the Civil Service Code. \n\"Faced with a government that is prepared to act in this cowardly, reckless way, it is left to the FDA to defend our members and the integrity of the civil service.\"\nThe FDA will now ask the High Court to prioritise its case - but there is no guarantee that judges will do so. \nBut if the case goes to a full hearing - even though no departure dates have yet been set - it could temporarily paralyse the policy. \nIn a worst case scenario, judges could rule that the government has created an unlawful conflict that then prevents top civil servants from implementing the plan. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the Home Office confirmed \"a series of nationwide operations\" was under way to detain people across the country ahead of their removal to Rwanda. \nPhotographs and a video were released of immigration enforcement officers detaining several migrants at different residences, before they were led away in handcuffs and put into secure vehicles.\nEach person being considered for forcible removal to Rwanda must be given at least seven days' written notice of that intention and they have the right to launch a legal challenge.\nThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks. \nLabour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. \nHowever, asked several times whether the party would release those detained as part of the policy, Labour's deputy nation campaign coordinator Ellie Reeves would not say.\n\"We want to get people back to their own countries if their claims have failed which is why we would set up those return agreements and also recruit a thousand case workers,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nLabour have said they would allow those who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum, something current arrivals are barred from doing.\nThe party added that no flights to Rwanda carrying asylum seekers would be scheduled by a Labour government.\nBut this does mean any already scheduled before the election, for departure afterwards, could still leave.\nThe precise nature of how Labour plan to handle the small boats issue is now the subject of considerable scrutiny, with the general election drawing closer and the legal framework it would inherit if it wins much clearer than it was.\nOn Monday it emerged that most of the asylum seekers initially earmarked for deportation to Rwanda could not be immediately located. On Monday it emerged that most of the asylum seekers initially earmarked for deportation to Rwanda could not be immediately located. \nHome Office documents show 5,700 asylum seekers have been identified in the initial cohort to be sent to Rwanda, but only \"2,143 continue to report to the Home Office and can be located for detention\".\nNo 10 said it was \"not accurate\" to say the Home Office was unable to locate the others, but a government source admitted it was possible some could abscond before they were detained.\nThe Home Office said it had increased detention capacity to more than 2,200 spaces and had 500 highly-trained escorts ready. \nThe department said commercial charters had also been booked and an airport had been put on standby. \nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"The government's move to detain people is causing fear, distress and great anxiety amongst men, women and children who have fled war and persecution to reach safety in the UK.\"\nHe said the government should focus on processing asylum claims \"efficiently and fairly\", rather than \"headline-grabbing schemes that will waste time and resources\".\nIt comes as figures showed 268 people arrived in the UK across the English Channel in five boats on Tuesday.\nA total of 7,567 people made the journey from January to April, provisional Home Office figures show.\nThe figure is 27% higher than the number of arrivals recorded in the same period last year. \nMeanwhile, a first failed asylum seeker has gone to Rwanda under a separate voluntary removals programme. \nUnder the scheme, announced in March, migrants whose claims are rejected are offered up to £3,000 to move to the east African country.\nThe Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.The Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called news of the voluntary return a \"pre-election gimmick,\" adding taxpayers were \"forking out £3,000 for a volunteer to board a plane\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"They've had to pay someone £3,000.

        "content": "Scientists at the University of Warwick have created a new way to detect skin cancer. Using so called Terahertz (THz) waves, with some early trials on patients already underway, the hope is to speed up surgery and help surgeons remove cancers while leaving as much healthy skin as possible.THz waves fall between infrared (used in remote controls) and microwaves on the electromagnetic spectrum. They can be used in scans to map the extent of tumours more accurately.\nScientists actually refer to the terahertz \"gap\" as it is a bit of the spectrum which we have a hard time actually generating and using the waves found there.That has started to change in the last few years, and as we have learned to make THz waves we can start to find uses for them. That is what the research at Warwick is all about.\nProf Emma MacPherson showed me round her lab and demonstrated how THz waves are now being used to detect skin cancer.She explained THz waves were \"a million times lower frequency than X-rays so it's really safe and it's really sensitive to subtle changes in water concentration\".In skin cancers, the amount of water in the skin is different when compared to the healthy skin around it. In theory you could use a THz wave producing machine to map very accurately the extent of any skin cancer.Which is why in her lab there is a student with his trousers rolled up having green dots stuck to his legs. These show the area under investigation to a robot arm with a THz generator on the tip.The robot then scans and maps out the extent of the cancer.\nAt the moment, a surgeon will draw on years of experience and eyeball the cancer to make a decision on how much to cut out. Surgery can take hours.But if Professor MacPherson's THz trials work, doctors could instead scan the cancer first and know exactly where to cut. It could potentially both speed things up and help preserve as much healthy skin as possible.Early trials on patients have been carried out and more are planned for the summer.As well as cancer, you the same approach could be used on skin disease like eczema, to analyse the skin and work out exactly the right course of treatment.If all goes well, in five years any skin cancer patient might go for a THz scan just like a patient with a broken bone goes for an x-ray.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "content": "Scientists have developed a \"self-digesting plastic\", which, they say, could help reduce pollution.\nPolyurethane is used in everything from phone cases to trainers, but is tricky to recycle and mainly ends up in landfill.\nHowever, researchers have come up with a sci-fi like solution.\nBy incorporating spores of plastic-eating bacteria they've developed a plastic that can self-destruct.\nThe spores remain dormant during the useful lifetime of the plastic, but spring back to life and start to digest the product when exposed to nutrients in compost.\nThere's hope \"we can mitigate plastic pollution in nature\", said researcher Han Sol Kim, of the University of California San Diego, La Jolla.\nAnd there might be an added advantage in that the spores increase the toughness of the plastic.\n\"Our process makes the materials more rugged, so it extends its useful lifetime,\" said co-researcher, Jon Pokorski. \"And then, when it's done, we're able to eliminate it from the environment, regardless of how it's disposed.\"\nThe plastic is currently being worked on at the laboratory bench but could be in the real world within a few years, with the help of a manufacturer, he added.\nThe type of bacteria added to the plastic is Bacillus subtilis, widely used as a food additive and a probiotic. The type of bacteria added to the plastic is Bacillus subtilis, widely used as a food additive and a probiotic. \nCrucially, the bacteria has to be genetically engineered to be able to withstand the very high temperatures needed to make plastic.\nBut not everyone is convinced by the idea of developing biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics. Some scientists argue it is far better to reduce the amount of plastic used in the first place.\nThe penultimate round of UN talks for a future plastics treaty have just drawn to a close in Canada, aimed at agreeing a global deal on tackling plastic pollution.\nProf Steve Fletcher, director of the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, said the most effective way of tackling plastic pollution was to agree on global legally binding cuts in plastic production.\nHe told BBC News: \"Care must be taken with potential solutions of this sort, which could give the impression that we should worry less about plastic pollution because any plastic leaking into the environment will quickly, and ideally safely, degrade. Yet, for the vast majority of plastics, this is not the case.\"\nThe research is published in the journal, Nature Communications.\nFollow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.",

        "content": "Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will face a new trial in the autumn after his state rape conviction was overturned, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\nManhattan prosecutors told the packed court: \"We believe in this case and will be retrying this case.\"\nAn appeals court ruled last week that Weinstein did not receive a fair trial in 2020.\nBut he remains jailed because of a separate rape conviction in California.\nWeinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.\nAt the court in New York on Wednesday, prosecutors said they would be ready to retry the case by September.\nAt the start of proceedings, Weinstein was brought in in a wheelchair, wearing a navy-blue suit and a light blue tie.\nHe appeared to be in good spirits, and smiled and waved to his team.\nAssistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the judge that one of Weinstein's victims was also in court. \nShe said the \"sexual assault survivor\" was there \"to show she's not backing down and is here to make sure justice is served once again. He may have power and privilege, but she has the truth.\"\nThe judge overseeing the case ruled that Weinstein's retrial will happen sometime after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September.\nLast week, the New York state appeals court ruled that the judge overseeing the former Hollywood mogul's case had erred when he allowed the testimony of women who made allegations about Weinstein for which he was never charged. \nThe judge had \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes\", the appeals court ruled by a vote of 4 to 3.\nThe decision also said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined in a way that portrayed him in a \"highly prejudicial\" light.\n\"The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial,\" the court found.\nWeinstein has always maintained his innocence and his defence team said at the time of the New York trial that sex between the movie executive and accusers was consensual.\nArthur Aidala, the movie mogul's lawyer, hailed the decision as a \"victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York\".\nWeinstein was taken to hospital a few days ago for what his lawyer described as \"immediate medical attention\" and \"a myriad of tests\".\nHe could be sent to the city's Rikers Island prison, or possibly to California to serve time there. \nJuda Engelmawer, a spokesman for Weinstein, told BBC News that his health condition has worsened in prison, but he is elated to have had his conviction vacated. \n\"He was relieved that the court saw it the way we did - that the trial wasn't fair,\" he said outside court.\n\"But he acknowledges his long road ahead of him.\"\nMr Engelmawer added that Weinstein hopes to remain in New York pending re-trial, in order to be nearer to his family and doctors. \nIn court, his lawyer argued that despite his health issues, Weinstein is \"sharp as a tack, smart as he ever was\".\nMr Aidala said that his client had read hundreds of books, so he had no concerns about his mental ability to participate in his legal defence.\nAt his New York trial in 2020, Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years.\nMs Haleyi has said she has reservations about returning to court again to attempt to re-convict Weinstein. \n\"It was retraumatising and gruelling and exhausting and all the things,\" she said at a news conference on Friday.\n\"I definitely don't want to actually go through that again. But for the sake of keeping going and doing the right thing and because it is what happened, I would consider it.\"\nMs Haleyi did not attend Wednesday's hearing in New York, but her attorney Gloria Allred appeared in court. \nSpeaking to press after the hearing, Ms. Allred said her client was still thinking about testifying again, but \"it's not an easy decision for her.\" Prosecutors in California say Weinstein's conviction for raping a woman in 2013 will stand up to any appeals challenge.\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by over 100 women. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York and 23-year prison term galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nMr Aidala told reporters that Weinstein was \"used to champagne and caviar\" and now is paying for crisps and M&M's at the prison commissary.\nHis films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.",

They want the UK government to bring him back home for treatment.\nAmnesty International has described Manuel's experience in detention as \"nothing short of horrific\" and says that his trial was \"marred by a range of due process violations.\" Its concerns are echoed by other human rights organisations the BBC has spoken to. \nQatari officials insist Manuel has been treated \"with respect and dignity\". \nAt first glance \"Gio\" - who also used the name \"Mike\" - looked like the thousands of other men on dating apps around the world.\nHis Grindr profile, seen by the BBC, was full of gym selfies showing off his six-pack. His listed interests were karaoke, football and Netflix. \nThe man also had a similar profile on Tinder, where his identity would have had to be verified by the app's facial recognition technology.\nEnrique says his brother swapped phone numbers with the man and invited him over to his apartment in Qatar's capital, Doha. \nBut when Manuel went down to the lobby of his building to meet \"Gio\", he was instead confronted by Qatari police officers, according to his brother, who says they immediately handcuffed Manuel and placed him under arrest. \nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar but Manuel, an airline worker, had lived a \"normal life\" for the past seven years and had never been in trouble with the authorities, his family says.\nQatari officials insist the 44-year-old's arrest in February was \"for possession of illegal substances on his person and in his apartment\" and that \"no other factors were taken into account\".\nThey say he \"acknowledged\" possessing illegal substances, adding: \"A drug test later came back positive, confirming the presence of illegal substances, specifically amphetamine and methamphetamine, in Mr Aviña's system at the time of his arrest.\"\nEnrique maintains that Manuel didn't take any drugs and says a small amount of methamphetamine was planted on him, which he was \"pressured\" into accepting was his.  \nBBC News has not been able to independently verify all of the claims made by Manuel and his family. Many of the accusations about his treatment after his arrest took place behind closed doors with few witnesses. \nHowever Manuel's family has presented a detailed timeline of events, and previous reporting, on both the treatment of LBGT people and the behaviour of police in the country, suggest others have had similar experiences.However Manuel's family has presented a detailed timeline of events, and previous reporting, on both the treatment of LBGT people and the behaviour of police in the country, suggest others have had similar experiences.\nWhile being held in custody at the police station, Manuel allegedly witnessed others being \"whipped on their backs\" by officers - and was threatened with similar treatment if he did not sign several legal documents.\nManuel told his family that these documents were written in Arabic - a language he could not read - and that he was not given access to a translator or any legal advice. \nHis brother says that when Manuel told the prison about his HIV they moved him into solitary confinement and would sporadically withhold his medication to pressure him into sharing information about other gay men - which he refused to do.  \nEnrique has told the BBC that Manuel was interrogated for hours at a time.\nWithholding medication in prison is \"morally intolerable\" and could already have had very serious consequences for Manuel's health, the UK's National Aids Trust says. \nThe charity is calling on the UK government to intervene and bring Manuel back for proper treatment. \nQatari officials have told the BBC that Manuel was \"treated with respect and dignity throughout his detention\".\nHe was told that he is facing anything from six months to three years in prison for possession and consumption of drugs. \nBut for the time being, after having spent 42 days in a Qatari detention centre, he has been granted provisional release and is staying with friends while he waits for further court appearances.  \nManuel's passport has been taken away - the conditions of his release mean he is banned from travelling abroad. \nDana Ahmed, a Middle East researcher at Amnesty International, says his treatment in detention, and later in his first trial sessions \"raises serious fears that Manuel is being targeted for his sexual orientation and is being coerced into providing the authorities with information that they could use to pursue a crackdown on LGBTI individuals in Qatar\". \nManuel's family has told the BBC that his usual treatment, prescribed by British doctors, ran out in mid-April. He now has to take an alternative provided by the Qatari authorities.\nBefore his arrest, Manuel's HIV was being treated with antiretroviral medication that he would receive during trips to the UK and Mexico. This kept the virus under control and meant he could not pass it on to others.\nIn a letter to the Foreign Office asking it to intervene, the National Aids Trust explained that by only being allowed to take his medication sporadically in prison, Manuel's body may have already built up a resistance, which would make it less effective and could have very serious health implications. \n\"We need Manuel to get access to treatment, but also access to professional medical expertise from a HIV clinician outside of Qatar to test him and properly assess what his future treatment needs are,\" says Daniel Fluskey, director of policy for National Aids Trust.\nThe Foreign Office says it is \"supporting a British man in Qatar\" and is \"in contact with his family\" - but it has declined to comment further. \nBut the BBC has seen a letter in which Foreign Secretary David Cameron tells a group of MPs concerned about Manuel's case that the government takes his health and welfare extremely seriously. He reassures them that he's \"closely following the case\" - but says the UK cannot intervene in the judicial affairs of another country.\nThe BBC was originally made aware of Manuel's case by the human rights organisation FairSquare, whose co-director, James Lynch, is a former British diplomat in Qatar. \n\"This has been about his LGBT status from the start and his desire to express that status and his identity, and that's what this case is about,\" says Mr Lynch, who is now supporting Manuel's family. \n\"He's an LGBT person and he was targeted through a dating app. You don't do that, unless that's the thing you are focused on.\"\nTo try to verify the family's claims, the BBC has also spoke to several other human rights experts. \nThe sort of interrogation Manuel allegedly experienced while in detention has been documented in the past. A 2022 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report which interviewed six LGBT Qataris found that all of them had been asked to hand over information that could identify others like them, and says that they had also witnessed or received physical abuse.\nRasha Younes, the deputy director of HRW's LGBT rights programme, has told the BBC that Qatari security forces are \"detaining and abusing LGBT people simply for who they are\", with ill-treatment including slapping, kicking and punching.\nShe adds that they also \"inflict verbal abuse, extract forced confessions and deny detainees access to legal counsel, family and medical care\". \nThe latest human rights report on Qatar from the US State Department says that in 2023, \"LGBTQI+ persons faced discrimination under the law and in practice\". The latest human rights report on Qatar from the US State Department says that in 2023, \"LGBTQI+ persons faced discrimination under the law and in practice\". \nIt adds: \"There were no government efforts to address potential discrimination, nor were there antidiscrimination laws to protect LGBTQI+ individuals targeted on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.\"\nQatar's treatment of LGBT people came under the spotlight when it hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Qatar's treatment of LGBT people came under the spotlight when it hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2022. \nAt the time, Qatari officials said \"everyone is welcome\" - but reports of LGBT people being \"hunted and abused\" are widespread, says Qatari LGBT activist, Dr Nas Mohamed.At the time, Qatari officials said \"everyone is welcome\" - but reports of LGBT people being \"hunted and abused\" are widespread, says Qatari LGBT activist, Dr Nas Mohamed.\nDr Mohamed, who has asylum in the US, came out publicly ahead of the tournament, but remains in contact with many gay Qataris.\n\"I don't know if Manuel used drugs or not. But the fact that he's been questioned on this is because he's gay and was hunted on Grindr,\" he says. \nFollowing Manuel's arrest, Grindr is now displaying a warning to users in Qatar that \"police are known to be making arrests on the app\".\nA spokesperson for Grindr says that the company is \"outraged\" by Manuel Aviña's case, and that it takes its role \"as a connector for the queer community very seriously\".\nThey add: \"Tragically, it is still illegal to be gay in more than 60 countries, in many of which Grindr is one of the only ways for members of the LGBTQ+ community to connect with one another.\"\nEnrique says it has been a difficult time for his brother Manuel and the whole family.\n\"When I saw him in the prison and I heard what had happened to him - it sounds like a case from another century,\" he says.\nHe is hoping that international attention, and interventions from organisations such as FairSquare, will mean his big brother is treated fairly.\nHe says Manuel now wants just one thing - to be brought back safely to the UK.",

The heat that we are experiencing, it could steadily increase in the coming days,\" Mr Estareja said.\nThe Philippines is in the middle of its warm and dry season, which is exacerbated by El Nino or the unusual warming of surface waters in the Pacific Ocean. The archipelago nation's entire east coast faces the Pacific.\nThe South East Asian nation is one of the most at risk countries in the world from the effects of climate change. Its wet season can bring about monster storms,  like Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, one of the most powerful in history.\n\"We are seeing that our dam levels will drop, including in Pantabangan and other areas,\" Mr Estareja said.\nThe water level there has fallen by nearly 50m from its normal high level of 221m, based on official data.\nThe ruins began to resurface in March as the area had been receiving almost no rain, Mr Paladin told AFP. The re-emergence of the ruins have drawn tourists to the town, some 202km (125 miles) north of the capital, Manila.\nAside from the Philippines, Bangladesh has also enforced class suspensions that have affected 33 million students.Aside from the Philippines, Bangladesh has also enforced class suspensions that have affected 33 million students.\nIn Thailand, 30 people have died of heatstroke between January and April 17 this year, compared with 37 in the whole of 2023, the health ministry said.

        "content": "What would it be like to meet one of our closest human relatives from 75,000 years ago in the flesh?\nScientists have produced a remarkable reconstruction of what a Neanderthal woman would have looked like when she was alive.\nIt is based on the flattened, shattered remains of a skull whose bones were so soft when excavated they had the consistency of \"a well-dunked biscuit\".\nResearchers first had to strengthen the fragments before reassembling them.\nExpert palaeoartists then created the 3D model.\nThe representation appears in a new BBC Studios documentary for Netflix called Secrets of the Neanderthals, which examines what we know about our long-lost evolutionary cousins, who became extinct about 40,000 years ago.\nThe sculpture puts a face to these people.\n\"I think she can help us connect with who they were,\" said Dr Emma Pomeroy, a palaeoanthropologist on the project from the University of Cambridge.\"I think she can help us connect with who they were,\" said Dr Emma Pomeroy, a palaeoanthropologist on the project from the University of Cambridge.\n\"It's extremely exciting and a massive privilege actually to be able to work with the remains of any individual but especially one as special as her,\" she told BBC News.\nThe skull on which the model is based was found in Shanidar Cave in Iraqi Kurdistan. It is an iconic place where the remains of at least 10 Neanderthal men, women and children were unearthed in the 1950s. \nWhen a British group was invited back by the Kurdish authorities in 2015, they soon chanced upon a new skeleton - dubbed Shanidar Z - that comprised much of the individual's upper-body, including the spine, shoulders, arms and hands.\nThe skull was largely all present, too, but squashed into a 2cm (0.7in)-thick layer, probably by a rock that had fallen from the roof of the cave at some point in the distant past.\n\"The skull was as flat as a pizza, basically,\" said Cambridge's Prof Graeme Barker, who leads the new excavations at Shanidar.\n\"It's a remarkable journey to go from that to what you see now. As an archaeologist, you can sometimes get blasé about what you're doing. But every now and then you are brought up short by the fact you are touching the past. We forget just what an extraordinary thing it is.\"\nWith permission of the local department of antiquities, the skull fragments were brought to the UK in blocks of sediment to begin the painstaking process of freeing them, stabilising them and then putting them back together.\nThe complicated jigsaw puzzle took an archaeological conservator more than a year to complete. \nThe rebuilt skull was then surface-scanned and a 3D print given to Dutch artists Adrie and Alfons Kennis, who are renowned for their skill in creating anatomically faithful representations of ancient people from their bone and fossil remains.\nBut as intriguing as the sculpture is, with her rather contemplative expression, it is the original skeleton that holds the real value.\nThe team is pretty sure \"she is a she\". \nPelvic bones would help the determination but those were not recovered with the upper-part of the body.\nInstead the researchers have relied on certain dominant proteins found in the tooth enamel that are associated with female genetics. The slight stature of the skeleton also supports the interpretation.\nHow old? She probably died in her mid-40s, indicated again by her teeth which are worn down almost to the roots.\n\"By the time the teeth are getting this worn, chewing is not as effective as it would have been - so she's not able to eat in quite the same way,\" explained Dr Pomeroy.\n\"We've got some other indications of poor dental health - some infections, some gum disease as well. By this time, I think she was getting to the natural end of life.\"\nFor a long time, scientists considered Neanderthals brutish and unsophisticated by comparison with our species. \nBut that view has been transformed since the discoveries at Shanidar.\nThe cave is famous for displaying what appears to be some kind of burial practice. Bodies were carefully placed in a gully next to a tall rock pillar. All the dead shared a similar orientation in how they were laid out.\nPollen throughout one skeleton led some to argue these Neanderthals might have been interred with flowers, suggestive perhaps of a spiritual awakening, even religion.\nBut the British team thinks it more likely the pollen was left by later burrowing bees, or perhaps from flowering branches that were placed on top of the bodies.\n\"Not because of the flowers on the branches but because the branches themselves could have prevented the likes of hyenas getting at the bodies,\" said Prof Chris Hunt of Liverpool John Moores University.\n\"I would hesitate to use the word 'burial'; I think I would use the word 'placement' to get away from the idea of a vicar and the church. But there's absolutely no doubt that they maintained a tradition of this is where you put grandma.\"\nSecrets of the Neanderthals arrives on the Netflix streaming platform globally on Thursday. \nAdditional reporting by Gwyndaf Hughes.",

In the adjacent Middelpos area there's a mixture of RDP homes and corrugated iron shacks built on an open field. \nThere is a marked sense of anxiety and suspicion in the two communities, particularly when they see an outsider or a car that is not from the area.\nThe rise in the number of parents and guardians eagerly waiting to collect their children outside the gates of the modest Diazville primary school is an indication of how much more care is being taken by residents to ensure the safety of young children in the area.\nGetting those adults to speak is not easy.\nThe reluctance is understandable given the media frenzy, and several instances of fake news disseminated on social media, such as alleged sightings and reports of a body being found.\nFaeeza Ecksteen, one of the parents who was prepared to talk, was at the school Joshlin attended to fetch her six-year-old son Aleem. \nShe says the disappearance of Joshlin, also spelled Joslin, has had a serious impact on the community, particularly the children.\n\"It's a very sad story. All parents are now worried about the wellbeing of their children and are taking extra care to ensure their safety.\"\n\"It's traumatising for the children in the area because they no longer want to play outside,\" adds community activist Carmelite Ross. \n\"My 11-year-old daughter, Keayondre, didn't want to go to school for the first few days after Joshlin's disappearance because she was scared, even though the school is just a few minutes away. She now walks to school every day with six other children.\n\"At the end of the day everyone in Saldanha, even our children, has been dragged into this matter.\"\nMs Ross, who participated in many of the searches for Joshlin in the first few days after the little girl's disappearance, chose to step back for her own wellbeing.\n\"I decided curtail my involvement in the Joshlin case because it started to take an emotional toll on me.\n\"As a mother myself, it's very painful. I've had sleepless nights because if it were my child I don't think I would still be alive due to all the worries, stress and everything that you have to deal with.\"\nTwo weeks after Joshlin's disappearance from her modest shack in the Middelpos informal settlement, police arrested her mother Racquel \"Kelly\" Smith, Smith's boyfriend Jacquen \"Boeta\" Appollis, Steveno van Rhyn and Phumza Sigaqa. That dwelling has since been locked up and stands deserted. \nThe four first appeared in the local magistrate's court on 7 March on charges of human trafficking and kidnapping. A large crowd of local people gathered around the court to call for \"justice for Joshlin\".\nThe first few days after her disappearance was accompanied by some racial tension between coloured (as people of mixed racial heritage are known in South Africa) and black members of the community following the arrest of Ms Sigaqa, a black person. She was caught up in a maelstrom of rumours and media reports incorrectly identified her as a traditional healer, or sangoma.\n\"There were days where people of this area labelled us as if we are the causes of Joshlin's disappearance. There were days when people were suspicious of sangomas, doing wrong things,\" Liwani Siyabulela, ward councillor for Middelpos, tells the BBC. \n\"We've managed to address the issues - we've made it clear it's not about being coloured or black or white, Indian or whatever. We should focus on finding the missing child. At least now the atmosphere is back to normal,\" says Ms Siyabulela, a member of the governing African National Congress (ANC). \nMs Ross acknowledges there may have been racial tensions initially but is happy that they were quickly resolved. \n\"I've never experienced such unity in this community. Everyone, no matter what race or culture - they were all there helping with the search. I saw the unity in our people.\"\nMs Sigaqa has been freed after charges against her were withdrawn due to a lack of evidence. She has since left her home which is just a few metres from where Joshlin lived following threats from members of the community.\nThe 32-year-old said in an interview with national television station Newzroom Afrika that police tortured her while she was in custody. The police have not responded to the allegations.\nLourentia Lombaard, who was reportedly the last person to see Joshlin before she went missing, was later arrested and is still in custody. \nAccording to National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila, Ms Lombaard has made a confession although more information will only be provided at a later stage.\nThe other three in custody have not commented on the charges, but Ms Smith had previously told local publication The Daily Voice that she had not given up hope of finding her daughter.\n\"My motherly instincts are telling me my daughter is still alive and in this area. We will find her, I will walk on foot to find her. I will look in every little shack, I'm going to do it by myself if I have to.\"\nThe disappearance of children continues to blight South African society.  \nAccording to Bianca van Aswegen, national co-ordinator of Missing Children South Africa (MCSA), figures released by the country's missing persons bureau in 2013 said that a child goes missing every five hours in the country, but they have not been updated since then. \nMCSA statistics show that just over three-quarters of the children are found but the others are suspected to be trafficked or killed.\nThe massive attention around Joshlin's disappearance, while welcome, is also intriguing since the same attention was not given to most of the other cases where children have gone missing. \n\"It could be that Joshlin's case hit social media by storm. Unfortunately, lots of people spread false information in the process which has hampered the investigation,\" says Ms Van Aswegen.\nBack at Joshlin's school everyone is hopeful that she will be found alive. \nOn the wall of the entrance hall there is a collection of messages of support from different classes alongside her portrait. \nThe school has also posted a video on its Facebook page in which an assembly of children sings \"God will work it out\".\nBut the young pupils also need to find a way to focus on themselves, school principal Lee-Ann Davids-Hartzenberg says.\n\"We are still hoping and praying for Joshlin's safe return, but need to operate and function daily to the best of our abilities. We need to move forward. Things are better this term but Joshlin's classmates are still missing her in the classroom.\n\"They regularly sing a hymn that she liked and they are also growing a plant in the class for her.\"",

He stood behind Mr Manele as the new leader addressed media on Thursday after his win. \"I will at all times put the interests of our people and country above all others,\" said Mr Manele said.He also noted that the election had proceeded peacefully - the Solomon Islands has previously experienced violence and street riots in the wake of votes.Hundreds of police and military officers from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have been stationed in the country since last month as a peacekeeping force.\"Today we show the world we are better than that - we must respect the democratic process for electing our prime minister,\" Mr Manele said.He said his government would aim to improving the economic situation for locals who have endured cost of living hikes.About 700,000 people live in the impoverished country which is made up of hundreds of islands.

        "content": "Scientists are trying to create a new type of bread that is just as healthy as wholemeal but looks and tastes like its white counterpart.Aimed at lovers of white bread, the project has been funded by the government to improve the health benefits of UK food.The researchers plan to add small amounts of peas, beans and cereals to the bread mix, as well as bran and wheat germ that are normally removed from white flour.Bread makers have attempted to make their white loaves healthier in the past by adding bran to their flour, but their customers didn't like the taste and texture. \nThe research project is still in its early stages. Dr Catherine Howarth of Aberystwyth University, who is one of its leaders, said scientists had begun to analyse the detailed chemical composition of existing white flour.She said boosting its nutritional values to the levels of wholemeal bread while keeping the taste and feel of white bread was a delicate balancing act.It involved adding back smaller quantities of the wheat germ and part of the bran that is taken out in the milling process, she said, as well as adding other grains that are richer in vitamins, minerals and fibre such as quinoa, teff, sorghum and millet. Green peas and chickpeas would provide extra protein.\n\"We want to find out exactly what vitamins and minerals are lost during the milling process,\" said Dr Howarth.\"Using other cereals we can enhance the iron, zinc and vitamin levels and most importantly the fibre content, because white bread has very little fibre, which is so important for good health.\"Once Dr Howarth has come up with some possible recipes, Chris Holister, a product development manager for Gloucestershire flour producer Shipton Mill, will turn them into bread.“Most people know that wholemeal bread is better for you, but a lot of them are put off by the flavour, or because it’s not what they are used to and they are simply not interested,” he said of the challenge.The final stage will be to test the new bread out on people to see if they can tell it apart from sliced supermarket white loaves.Mr Holister used me as a guinea pig for an early prototype made from a mixture of normal white flour and some added grains and peas.It was crustier than the white loaves you get from the supermarket - but otherwise looked and tasted like white bread. But there is a lot more work to be done.It is hoped that a product could be on supermarket shelves in about two years' time.\nThe research team believe that their approach will succeed because they are adding only the inner layer of the bran, which is less strongly flavoured and coloured. They say they will need to add less of it because they are using other highly nutritious but less strongly flavoured grains.White bread has to have minerals and vitamins added to it by law to make up for the goodness that's lost in the refining process. But Dr Amanda Lloyd, who is working with Dr Howarth and Mr Holister, believes that the use of natural ingredients would make the sliced white loaf even healthier. “If the nutritional quality of bog standard bread is improved,” said Dr Lloyd, “then the quality of  people’s life and their health and wellbeing will improve.”Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City University, who is independent of the research team, said that the work could be an important step forward in improving people’s health.“The British have had a love affair with white bread for more than a century and nutritionists have longed to get more people to eat the whole grain,\" he said. \"The new research seems like a really interesting approach to doing that. \"Critics would say that it is tricking people into improving their diet, but nutritionists would say it doesn’t matter how it’s done - it’s important to get it down people’s throats to improve their health! \"But the jury's out as to whether this new approach will work,” he added.\n\nAccording to the British Diabetic Association, the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes may be up to 30% lower in people who regularly eat wholegrains and the risk of bowel cancer may be also reduced.According to the British Diabetic Association, the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes may be up to 30% lower in people who regularly eat wholegrains and the risk of bowel cancer may be also reduced.The BDA says surveys show that 95% of adults don’t eat enough wholegrains and nearly one in three of us get none at all.That was not always the case, according to Chris Holister.“It used to be the case that white bread was for the upper class because it was a refined product and a lot more expensive than wholemeal bread. So that led to everyone else wanting white bread because it made them look better,\" he said.“Then some people switched back the other way when research showed that it is more nutritious.”But Chris doesn’t think it will come full circle because so many people are so accustomed to eating sliced white bread.\"White bread is so much cheaper than wholemeal because firms are geared up to producing it. And it's also what most people are used to.\"\nFollow Pallab on X, formerly known as TwitterFollow Pallab on X, formerly known as Twitter",

The latter have been repeatedly linked to deforestation in South America.Mr Collins says the product is a more environmentally-friendly alternative to the soybean-based animal feeds that dominate the market. The latter have been repeatedly linked to deforestation in South America.\nHe also claims that the firm's insect-based feed has a carbon footprint that is \"100 times lower than that of soymeal\".\nStudies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon footprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the insects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that soybean-based feed produces less carbon.Studies agree that insect-based feed generally does have a lower carbon footprint, but only if the larvae have been fed natural food waste. If the insects have been given a processed food source, then one report says that soybean-based feed produces less carbon.\nMr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein, compared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed more filling and nutritious.Mr Collins adds that the feed made by Full Circle, contains up to 70% protein, compared with soy, which has less than 50% protein - making the insect feed more filling and nutritious.\nFounded in 2019, Full Circle now employs 14 people, and supplies 49 farms across Thailand. It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based feed is currently substantially cheaper.\nSoybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; £400) per tonne, compared with €1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.Soybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; £400) per tonne, compared with €1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.\nTo try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to help maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI system to study all available past and present data on insect farming to determine and then continuously fine tune the best methods.\nThis can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum space that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of flies, and whether to introduce new strains or species.\n\"AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome obstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production, to be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,\" says Mr Collins.\n\"AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming to date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every time we grow one.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nSome 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is also working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software that automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will enable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for itself.\nCogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to launch it commercially in the next three years.\nIts founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of companies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily available. \"We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of software, and we have been here already for five years.\n\"It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to understand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we would be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs. So we now have a baseline to build an AI solution.\n\"But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that they have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model before they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data, and to have data you need to have some customers first.\"\nShe adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works.\nBack at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based expert in the field called Simon Christofides.\nMr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed commercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn, and that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process.\n\"Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years of passed down generational learning,\" he says. \"Black soldier fly larvae have been farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in our current understanding.\"\nMr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights \"no human could ever achieve\", by using multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points.\nYet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with things on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate on green ribbons laid out in such a way as to account for their territorial tendencies.\n\"You need to consider their social and behavioural dynamics as animals,\" says Mr Collins.",

When Israel's military arrives, shops close quickly in Jenin, a city in the West Bank - Palestinian territory which, unlike Gaza, is not run by Hamas.Witnesses said gunfire had been ringing out from a nearby operation by Israel's army in the Jenin refugee camp.Adam, a football fanatic and massive Lionel Messi fan, stood with his older brother Baha, 14. There were about nine boys on the street in total, all captured on CCTV cameras that provided a nearly 360-degree view of what happened next.\nA few hundred metres away, a convoy of at least six armoured Israeli military vehicles turned a corner and began heading towards the boys, who clearly became uneasy. Several of the boys started to move away.At this precise moment, mobile phone footage shows the front door of an armoured vehicle opened. The soldier inside had a direct view of the boys. Basil had darted into the middle of the road, while Adam was 12m further from the soldiers, running away.Then at least 11 gunshots rang out.Examining the scene, the BBC found the bullets struck a wide area. Four bullets hit a metal pole, two the shutter of the hardware store, one burrowed its way through the bumper of a parked car, and another pierced a handrail.Medical reports obtained by the BBC show that two shots hit Basil in the chest.Another bullet struck eight-year-old Adam in the back of the head as he ran away; his older brother Baha desperately tried to drag him to cover, leaving a trail of blood as he screamed for an ambulance.\nBut it was too late. Baha said Adam and his friend Basil died in front of him.“I was in a state of shock; I wasn’t even thinking about myself. I tried to speak to him. I started saying, ‘Adam, Adam!’ But his soul was basically leaving his body because he didn't answer,” Baha told the BBC tearfully.Before being shot, Basil can be seen clutching something in his hand. It is not clear what it is. The IDF later shared a picture taken at the scene, which it says shows an explosive device.\nEvidence from our investigation of the scene was shared with a number of independent experts, including human rights lawyers, a war crimes investigator and a counter-terrorism expert, as well as members of the UN and other, neutral bodies. Some gave their analysis anonymously.The experts agreed the incident should be investigated and some went further, saying there appeared to be violations of international law.Ben Saul, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said there may be questions about whether lethal force could have been used legally in Basil's case, if he was holding an explosive.\"For Adam, this appears to be a violation of the International Humanitarian Law prohibitions on deliberately, indiscriminately or disproportionately attacking civilians, a war crime, and a violation of the human right to life,\" Mr Saul said.Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said: \"The soldiers were in armoured vehicles. Even if there was a threat, they should have driven away and planned an arrest, rather than defaulting to apparently indiscriminate, lethal force, which is a violation of international law.”\nThe IDF said the suspects had been about to hurl explosives towards their forces, putting them in immediate danger. \"The troops responded with fire and hits were identified,\" Israel's military said.But according to the video evidence we have examined and witness testimony, Adam did not appear to have been armed and had been running away when he was shot in the back of the head.The IDF said the circumstances of Basil and Adam's deaths are \"under review\", which it does routinely for every death of a child in the West Bank due to IDF activity.But several former Israeli soldiers who viewed the BBC's evidence said they believed Israel’s legal system would protect soldiers who used lethal force, regardless of whether it was justified.One former sergeant who served in the West Bank from 2018-2020, said it would take \"an Israeli soldier murdering a Palestinian at zero range for it to be taken as murder in Israel\" and \"there is basically a 0% chance of criminal proceedings\" against a soldier in cases such as Adam's.Data from the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din suggests that fewer than 1% of all complaints against Israeli soldiers result in prosecutions.\nThe Other WarIsobel Yeung navigates gun battles, combat raids and secretive meetings deep inside the occupied West Bank. What she finds raises serious questions about the conduct of the Israeli military.Watch on on BBC iPlayer (UK only)Watch on on BBC iPlayer\nFootage of the Hamas attack on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage, outraged the Israeli public and shocked the world. Since then, the world's attention has been focused on the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.At the same time, military operations by Israel have also surged in the occupied West Bank, making last year the deadliest year on record for children there.A total of 124 children were killed in 2023, according to Unicef - 85 of whom were reported killed after 7 October.So far in 2024, 36 Palestinian children have been killed in the territory by Israeli settlers or the military.Since the West Bank is not classed as a war zone, the use of force is meant to be more constrained, according to international law.\nWhile the IDF keeps its exact rules of engagement secret, former and serving Israeli soldiers told us the use of lethal force was meant to be a last resort where there is a real and imminent danger to life. A staged approach should be taken.They say this begins with a verbal warning in Arabic and Hebrew, before escalating to the use of non-lethal weapons such as tear gas, then shooting at the legs, all before shooting to kill.The BBC was given access by the Palestinian Authority-run health ministry in the West Bank to medical reports of 112 children, aged between two and 17, who were killed by Israeli fire between January 2023 and January 2024. We cannot know the exact circumstances of all of these shootings, and it is possible that some genuinely posed a threat to the lives of Israeli soldiers.But our analysis showed that about 98% of them had injuries to the upper body, where a shot is more likely to be fatal, meaning that soldiers could be shooting to kill more often than wound in these cases.It raises questions about whether soldiers are following the rules of engagement in the West Bank and the culture around how they use lethal force.\nOver a period of five weeks in the West Bank examining the impact of military operations, we saw evidence of several incidents which raised serious questions about the army's conduct.The BBC witnessed a 45-hour military operation by Israel in Tulkarm refugee camp in January 2024, targeting an armed group known locally as the Resistance.Afterwards, several Palestinians told us they had been threatened by soldiers at gunpoint and told to move to neighbouring Jordan. The IDF has said it will review any complaints about civilians being threatened.Haytham, a 12-year-old Canadian-Palestinian boy, said he had been threatened at knife-point by an Israeli soldier, a claim backed up by his brother and father.In one family home in the camp, we found a mural of al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, that had been defaced - allegedly by Israeli soldiers.An adjoining wall bore the Star of David, spray-painted, and another had \"7 October\" in Hebrew written on it, a reference to the Hamas attack.The IDF has said that this vandalism \"contradicts IDF values\" and is contrary to what it expects from its soldiers.\nUpstairs the house had been ransacked, with kitchen cabinets smashed, children's toys damaged, and televisions broken. It was a similar picture in house after house, throughout the camp.Dr Eitan Diamond, a senior legal expert at the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Jerusalem, said that “vandalism, such as spraying the Star of David or ‘October 7' on walls, is clearly unlawful\".The reports about a child being threatened with a knife in Tulkarm camp - and others being threatened at gunpoint - could also be breaches of international law, he said.In the same IDF operation, after soldiers shot dead an alleged Palestinian fighter who may have been carrying explosives, witnesses told us that his body had been urinated on, struck, bound and then dragged down the street.The BBC was shown photos of a bound body. Examining the bloodstained scene, we found cloth and cable left behind, which was consistent with the material used to bind the body in the pictures.\nOur evidence was again shown to independent experts. Prof Marco Sassoli, an international law expert from the University of Geneva, said: “Remains of the deceased, even if they were lawfully killed, must be respected. What you report violates international humanitarian law and may even constitute a war crime.”The IDF said that after examining the dead fighter, explosives had been found and Red Crescent personnel refused to touch the body. \"For this reason, IDF troops had to restrain his hands and feet to ensure their safety and to check if there was weaponry under the body.\"Some of the former Israeli soldiers who reviewed the BBC's evidence said they were afraid that the culture of IDF operations in the West Bank was further stoking Palestinian armed resistance.\"To assume that people can interact with the army the way Palestinians do on a daily basis and still go about their lives as if nothing happened - that people living in this reality will not take up arms - is at best naive and dehumanising,\" one said. \"Things are getting worse.\"",

        "content": "Scientists have developed a \"self-digesting plastic\", which, they say, could help reduce pollution.\nPolyurethane is used in everything from phone cases to trainers, but is tricky to recycle and mainly ends up in landfill.\nHowever, researchers have come up with a sci-fi like solution.\nBy incorporating spores of plastic-eating bacteria they've developed a plastic that can self-destruct.\nThe spores remain dormant during the useful lifetime of the plastic, but spring back to life and start to digest the product when exposed to nutrients in compost.\nThere's hope \"we can mitigate plastic pollution in nature\", said researcher Han Sol Kim, of the University of California San Diego, La Jolla.\nAnd there might be an added advantage in that the spores increase the toughness of the plastic.\n\"Our process makes the materials more rugged, so it extends its useful lifetime,\" said co-researcher, Jon Pokorski. \"And then, when it's done, we're able to eliminate it from the environment, regardless of how it's disposed.\"\nThe plastic is currently being worked on at the laboratory bench but could be in the real world within a few years, with the help of a manufacturer, he added.\nThe type of bacteria added to the plastic is Bacillus subtilis, widely used as a food additive and a probiotic. The type of bacteria added to the plastic is Bacillus subtilis, widely used as a food additive and a probiotic. \nCrucially, the bacteria has to be genetically engineered to be able to withstand the very high temperatures needed to make plastic.\nBut not everyone is convinced by the idea of developing biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics. Some scientists argue it is far better to reduce the amount of plastic used in the first place.\nThe penultimate round of UN talks for a future plastics treaty have just drawn to a close in Canada, aimed at agreeing a global deal on tackling plastic pollution.\nProf Steve Fletcher, director of the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, said the most effective way of tackling plastic pollution was to agree on global legally binding cuts in plastic production.\nHe told BBC News: \"Care must be taken with potential solutions of this sort, which could give the impression that we should worry less about plastic pollution because any plastic leaking into the environment will quickly, and ideally safely, degrade. Yet, for the vast majority of plastics, this is not the case.\"\nThe research is published in the journal, Nature Communications.\nFollow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.",

When Dua Lipa headlines Glastonbury this June, it will be her first appearance at Worthy Farm since playing the cramped John Peel stage in 2017.At the time, it was the biggest crowd she'd ever played to.

The gig felt like \"a massive step up”.\nAt that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop.At that point, Dua Lipa was not yet Dua Lipa: The globe-conquering, Brit Award-winning, pandemic-soundtracking, Barbie-starring purveyor of glossy disco pop.But one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules, and her career changed overnight.But one month later, she released the pastel-hued video for New Rules, and her career changed overnight.A number one in the UK, and her first hit in the US, the song's message of female solidarity propelled her into main pop-girl territory, after years of hustling behind the scenes.\nThe song clocked up its three-billionth play on YouTube this January – just as Dua started ramping up the campaign for her highly anticipated third album, Radical Optimism.It’s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns.It’s a record that sees her navigating life after a major break-up, and establishing new New Rules to break a pattern of dating wrong ‘uns.“Before, I would see a red flag and be like, ‘Oh, how beautiful’,” she laughs.“It could be anything: One sly, demeaning comment that you brush off… and then you realise it's a pattern.“I’ve learned to not kid myself.”\nThose lessons permeate the album’s punchy, keyed-up dance anthems. On the singles Training Season and Houdini, she vets prospective partners, and shows the door to anyone who falls below her standards.The lyrics were inspired by a string of bad dates she endured after coming out of a two-year relationship with Anwar Hadid (brother of Bella and Gigi Hadid).But how does dating work for someone at Dua Lipa’s level of fame? Are people intimidated to ask her out?“I don't know if people feel free to approach me,” Dua muses. “Maybe?“Dating apps, for me, I don't think would work. They might think they’re being catfished.“I like to go on a friend’s recommendation. It makes it easier when they're vetted.\"\nWhen a match is made, her expectations for a first date are charmingly unstarry.“I like a walk in the park,\" she says. \"You can chat and walk and get to know someone. No frills. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy.“Having a good conversation is the best thing. That's how you see if you gel, if there's a spark.”For now, at least, that's not a concern. Dua has been in a relationship with British actor Callum Turner since the beginning of the year.And her personal life will have to take a back seat as she gears up for a busy summer.\nRadical Optimism is released on Friday, with Dua hosting and singing on Saturday Night Live a day later (the last British artist invited to do that was Harry Styles).In addition, she’s got her podcast series, the weekly arts and culture newsletter Service95, and an upcoming Disney documentary series about Camden’s music scene, which she executive produced.But looming over everything is Dua’s return to Glastonbury. This time on the Pyramid Stage.“I think about it all the time,” she says.“Fifty per cent of my thoughts go to Glastonbury, then the rest are for everyday tasks.”Her journey to the top of the bill is a story of aspiration, setbacks and tenacity that goes right back to childhood.\nDua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars.Dua was born in London in 1995, about three years after her parents, Dukagjin and Anesa, emigrated from Kosovo, having witnessed the beginnings of what would become the Balkan wars.A natural performer, Dua’s enthusiasm was thwarted by her primary school music teacher, who put her through a humiliating public audition in front of the whole school.“He started playing the piano and I’m trying to hit this high note, and nothing comes out. Literally just air,” she recalls.“Everyone in assembly laughed. I was so embarrassed. It was a big moment for me in my life.”\nSalvation came at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where the young Dua Lipa enrolled as a weekend student.There, she was taken under the wing of singing tutor Ray Lamb. Recognising that her voice skewed towards the lower end of the mezzo-soprano range, he instantly removed her from the junior choir and put her in with the teens.She was “mortified” to be singing next to children who were twice her height, but says Ray “helped me build my confidence”.“He was the toughest one, the scariest one, but really soft, deep down. And when he told you that you were good, you had a real sense of validation. He was the teacher that really made me feel I had something.”\nDua Lipa: Headlining GlastonburyWatch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BBC iPlayer (UK only).Watch the extended interview with Dua Lipa on BBC iPlayer (UK only).\nEncouraged, she started posting cover songs to YouTube (“I thought I’d get discovered like Justin Bieber”) until, all of a sudden, her parents decided to move back to Kosovo.Dua stuck it out for two years before persuading the family she should return to London. There, she shared a flat with a family friend, taking jobs in retail and modelling to pay her rent, while “trying to get school over with as quickly as possible”.Her first demos were released in 2012. A year later, after appearing in an X Factor commercial, she signed with Lana Del Rey's manager, Ben Mawson, who sent her for two years of intensive writing sessions.Her first demos were released in 2012. A year later, after appearing in an X Factor commercial, she signed with Lana Del Rey's manager, Ben Mawson, who sent her for two years of intensive writing sessions.The results included early singles like Be The One and Hotter Than Hell; but it took a while for Dua to climb the rocky peaks of pop. Her debut album was delayed three times before New Rules lit a rocket underneath her career.\nSuddenly, she was learning her job in the full glare of the spotlight. Some of her early TV performances lacked polish, as the singer got used to juggling live vocals with camera angles and choreography. A stilted performance at a German festival spawned the \"go girl, give us nothing\" meme, which still stings to this day.\"It made me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough or I didn't deserve to be there, I wasn't cut out to be a musician. \" she told America’s National Public Radio in 2022.\"It made me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough or I didn't deserve to be there, I wasn't cut out to be a musician. \" she told America’s National Public Radio in 2022.These days, those early wobbles are a distant memory.Dua opened both the 2024 Grammy and the Brit Awards, with high-concept, acrobatic dance numbers that could have been lifted straight from a movie musical.Creating those performances counts as “some of the most rewarding work I have done with an artist in my career”, says her long-time choreographer Charm La’Donna.“I really admire Dua's work ethic and the grit she has to keep challenging herself as a performer. We have such a good time creating together that at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like work.\"\nDua says the title of her new album, Radical Optimism, is partly a reference to the uncertainty of her early days.“I thought it was so important, the idea of pushing through when things feel like they aren't going well. Because often, with hindsight, you can say, ‘This thing that really upset me, I can see from a different perspective now’.”It’s a mindset she brought to the album. Writing sessions actually began in 2021, as a way of staying productive when the pandemic put her Future Nostalgia tour on hold.“I knew the title that early,” she says. “I felt like I had to write myself into a good idea.”However, the early sessions were fruitless. The new sound she was searching for didn’t materialise until she finally hit the road in 2022.The thrill of playing her music with a live band inspired her to take the same approach in the studio. Programmed beats and loops were replaced by live drums, flamenco guitar and even, on a song called Maria, the sound of a Polynesian nose flute.She calls it “alternative but pop, with a touch of psychedelia”. \nFans will hear 11 tight, summer holiday-ready pop bangers - and the ones who pay attention to the lyrics will notice a big shift in Dua’s perspective.Her first album was full of screw-you anthems, aimed at a cheating boyfriend. But the final song on Radical Optimism, Happy For You, finds her wishing an ex good luck with his new partner.“Even the hard parts were all for the best,” she sings over a swirling piano motif. “I must have loved you more than I ever knew.\"“Even the hard parts were all for the best,” she sings over a swirling piano motif. “I must have loved you more than I ever knew.\"“That’s definitely a new emotion,” says the star. “\"I used to be much more impulsive and reactive [but] not every break-up has to be a bad one.”Her writing feels more specific on this album. On Watcha Doing, Dua admits the damage her need for control causes in relationships; while These Walls is a Polaroid picture of a couple realising their time is up, that reaches Abba levels of domestic misery.It’s a corrective to critics who’ve sometimes described Dua’s work as anonymous or faceless.“As a pop artist, there's always the stigma of not being taken seriously,” she says. “Pop music makes you feel good, so it can't be deep, or honest, or real.“But it's a challenge I'm willing to take on: Putting the meaning back into pop.”\nIt’s notable that Dua’s album arrives within weeks of headline releases by Ariana Grande, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, with new material from Billie Eilish due in May.In the past, they’d have been pitted against each other by a press hungry for drama.But not this time.“We’re definitely growing up,” says Dua. “People are being held accountable for the way they choose to portray women.”Setting up false rivalries “creates friction” and adds “pressure to a relationship that’s not yet fully formed”, she argues. That stifles artists’ ability to collaborate and support one another, and she’s thankful a corner has been turned.“We’re in a moment in time where there’s so much camaraderie and I think it’s working in our favour,” she says.“It’s amazing to see so many women putting out albums at the same time. And everyone is so different, with such different stories to tell, so why isn’t there room for everyone?”\nGlastonbury proves that there is. For the first time ever, the festival will have two female headliners – with Dua joined by US R&B phenomenon SZA.“I feel so lucky to be a part of that shift,” says Dua. “It’s important to have more female headliners. We’ve just got to keep applying the pressure and making that change happen.”The booking is effectively a coronation for the new queen of British pop – and Dua is determined to make it count.She casts her mind back to her first tour, when she’d invite the audience on stage for the encore of Blow Your Mind (Mwah), and wonders how that would work on the Pyramid Stage.“It might be tight,” she laughs. “But I’ve got to figure out a way to make 150,000 people feel like they’re in a small little nightclub.“That’s the goal, and if there’s one place to do it, it’s gotta be Glasto.”Let’s just hope she takes care of her tailbone this time.",

        "content": "US singer Olivia Rodrigo has expressed her disappointment after becoming the latest act to fall foul of a crisis at Manchester's troubled Co-op Live arena.\nShe was due to launch her UK tour with two sold-out gigs at the new venue this weekend, but they have been called off.\nThe decision came after the arena's opening was postponed for a third time on Wednesday when a fault scuppered a gig by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.\nRodrigo told fans she was \"sooooo disappointed\" not to perform her shows.\n\"I'm so bummed and I really hope to see you all soon,\" the chart-topping pop star wrote on Instagram, saying she and her team were \"doing our best\" to reschedule the concerts.\nRodrigo's fans have also had their plans wrecked, with many left out of pocket. Scott Tostevin, from Guernsey, had booked flights and a hotel for himself and two friends to see her on Friday night.\nHe told the BBC the group had spent several hundred pounds on the trip.\n\"I can either use my flights and hotel to now sit and watch a film in Manchester or lose the money and just cancel it all with no refunds,\" he said.\nThe decision to postpone major shows by one of the world's biggest artists is another big embarrassment for the Manchester arena after a series of delays.\nThe £365m venue, the UK's largest indoor arena with space for 23,500 people, was due to be opened by comedian Peter Kay last week, but his shows have been postponed twice.\nBosses decided Rodrigo's shows could not go ahead after A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's concert was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday.\nThousands of his fans were waiting outside the venue when they were informed about the announcement, which came 10 minutes after doors had been due to open.\nThe arena's operators blamed an incident during the soundcheck, when \"a component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, used to direct air, separated from the ductwork\".\nThey said no-one had been injured and that they were \"deeply sorry\", but the whole system would need to be tested for further defects.\nTicket-holders, many of whom had travelled for miles, were left disappointed, and the rapper wrote on social media: \"I'm heated about the situation too, but safety first Manchester, I got you, just stay tuned for further info.\"\nOne fan told the BBC it was \"very unprofessional\", while another criticised the \"bad organisation\".\nThe venue's operators, Oak View Group, said they appreciated \"the inconvenience\" this would cause for \"many\". The fault had been caused by a \"factory defect\" with a nozzle used to direct air, they added.\nHowever, staff were unable to verify that other such nozzles were free of similar problems.\nFan Katie Barnsley, who travelled up from Kent for the gig, found out it had been cancelled just as she was about to get a tram from Manchester city centre to the arena in the Etihad Campus.\nThe 28-year-old insurance broker had travelled up from near Dover with her partner and his sister, and estimated they had spent around £600 on tickets, accommodation and petrol.\nShe said: \"We were going on the tram and were asking the attendant how we got to the campus and he said, 'Don't bother, it's been cancelled'.\n\"Then I went on Twitter and saw the tweet from the arena.\"\nMs Barnsley said she had been apprehensive about travelling to Manchester because of the cancellation of earlier gigs at the venue but had been reassured by recent tweets from Co-op Live saying other shows would be going ahead.\nSome fans outside the venue were handed a sheet of paper saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie's gig had been cancelled for \"technical reasons\".\nZack, also 17, had come from Blackpool for the show. \"I'm on crutches and we queued up for about two hours, wasting our time,\" he said.\n\"They came out with these sheets of paper saying 'we're sorry about this', but we'd found out already from people shouting, people running around shouting that it's cancelled before they [the staff] even came out themselves.\"\nTeoni Kirkham, 21, said: \"We literally hopped out of our Uber and just saw everybody turning around and walking the opposite way. We found out literally when we got here.\n\"It's just messy, really. It seems like there's no organisation. With Ticketmaster on my phone, I thought, surely if it's been cancelled I would have got notification. They've not done a good job I don't think.\"\nThe next show in the schedule is Keane on Sunday, followed by a five-night residency by Take That next week.\nThe venue said it understood \"the need to reassure fans over future shows\", but did not rule out further postponements.\n\"We are working with artist management and promoters to limit the impact on the opening season schedule,\" its statement said.\n\"Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows.\n\"Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.\"\nOak View Group chief executive Tim Leiweke apologised to fans but defended the cancellation.\nHe added: \"The safety and security of all visiting and working on Co-op Live is our utmost priority, and we could not and will not run any event until it is absolutely safe to do so.\n\"Today was a very unexpected situation but without a doubt the right decision.\"\nThe Co-operative Group, which sponsors the venue, said it was \"shocked\" by what had happened.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are relieved that no-one has been injured, but we share the disappointment and frustration of ticket holders, many of whom are Co-op members, with the continuing delay to the opening of Co-op Live and the disruption that this is causing to everyone who has been looking forward to attending events.\n\"We will be seeking a full explanation from Oak View Group, who are responsible for the building, to the obvious questions arising from this, together with a clear plan from the Co-op Live venue management team at OVG for opening the venue and postponed and future events.\"\nLast week, Co-op Live's general manager Gary Roden resigned following the initial delays and a backlash over comments he had made about some smaller live music venues being \"poorly run\".Last week, Co-op Live's general manager Gary Roden resigned following the initial delays and a backlash over comments he had made about some smaller live music venues being \"poorly run\".\nRebecca Kane-Burton, who has run the O2 arena in London and Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber's LW Theatres, was drafted in to replace him.\nRodrigo opened the European section of her Guts world tour in Dublin on Tuesday, but now has a gap in her diary before dates in Glasgow, Birmingham and London.\nHer tour made headlines in the US when contraceptives and morning-after pills were handed out at a concert in Missouri, where abortion is banned.Her tour made headlines in the US when contraceptives and morning-after pills were handed out at a concert in Missouri, where abortion is banned.\nDo you have tickets to a show at Co-op Live?

        "description": "Gordon Brown has called for police to investigate whether the publisher of the Sun and News of the World covered up phone hacking evidence.",
        "content": "Gordon Brown has called for police to investigate whether the publisher of the Sun and News of the World covered up phone hacking evidence.\nThe former prime minister told the BBC that civil court documents show News UK deleted emails to stop police seeing them.\nHe also believes his phone may have been hacked while in No 10 and could now take legal action.\nNews UK said Mr Brown's allegations were \"unfounded and wrong\". \nIn 2015, prosecutors said there was no evidence of corporate wrongdoing.\nHowever, Mr Brown said that decision was based on an \"incomplete picture\" of the case against News UK, previously known as News Group Newspapers.\nHe said: \"What we have is new evidence. What we now know was not available at the time, perhaps not even available to the police.\n\"What is coming out is the extent of the interference in people's civil liberties, the extent to which the organisation tried to cover up.\" \nHe said he was speaking out on behalf of \"ordinary families\" targeted by newspapers \"at the moment of greatest difficulty for them - grief, tragedy, accidents, murders\".\nVictims of phone hacking include the murdered teenager Milly Dowler and families bereaved by the 7 July 2005 terror attacks in London.\nMr Brown continued: \"The intrusion into their private lives at the time of grief was so extensive, whether it be by phone hacking, or by using private investigators or by investigating their family life and the relatives of people around them.\"\nThe police investigation into the company was brought to a halt in 2015 after the convictions of senior journalists including Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World.\nThe company had accepted journalists at the tabloid were involved in wrong-doing and closed it down in 2011.\nIt has paid damages to hundreds of News of the World phone hacking victims, and has also settled cases brought by those targeted by the Sun, without admitting any liability.\nMore than 40 people are currently suing News UK for hacking their phones or unlawfully obtaining their private information.\nThe complex case is likely to go to trial next year but evidence is already being disclosed to the claimants' lawyers.\nA key question in the trial is likely to be why the company deleted more than 30 million emails in 2010 and 2011, when it knew it faced a police investigation over phone hacking.\nNine million emails, detailing important periods during the phone hacking saga, were \"irretrievably lost\", according to court documents.\nThe reasons for the email deletion policy are at the centre of claims the firm was involved in a corporate cover-up which went beyond the wrong-doing of individual reporters and private investigators.\nNews UK has always insisted it was clearing out old computer servers, but claimants say it was deleting evidence at the time the police investigation was expanding. \nThey have accused the company in court filings of inventing a false \"security threat\" to provide another reason why emails needed to be deleted.\nCourt documents filed by the claimants suggest senior figures at the News UK believed an insider sympathetic to the Labour Party had leaked emails belonging to chief executive Rebekah Brooks.\nThey believed these had been passed to a third party, who had then met and discussed them with Gordon Brown.\nThe court documents suggest the company decided to delete Mrs Brooks's emails to prevent further leaks.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Brown discussed this claim for the first time, describing it as an \"an attempt to blame someone else... when, of course, they themselves were guilty of destroying evidence\".\nHe denied ever being passed information relating to Mrs Brooks, adding: \"The police should never have accepted their explanation.\"\nMr Brown has never taken legal action against News UK but revealed he is now considering it.\nHe said it was possible that his phone was hacked between 2005 and 2007 when he was chancellor, and for the three years he was prime minister, before losing the 2010 election.\nMr Brown said he had a personal mobile phone at the time, and believes his voicemail messages may have been accessed.\nHe continued: \"If a prime minister was having his phone hacked by News Group, then that is a very serious matter.\n\"And we need to get all the evidence about what happened, what didn't happen, what was happening at their headquarters.\n\"I think that is all still to come out. And that's why although time has passed, we must not allow this to happen again because of a failure to investigate what happened in the past.\"\nIn response, News UK said Mr Brown's allegations related to events from over a decade ago which are the subject of current legal proceedings in the civil courts. \nA spokesperson added: \"There is absolutely no evidence to support the assertion that Mr Brown's voicemails were intercepted and this is denied.\" \nThe company has also denied in court documents it deleted millions of emails because they were \"potentially incriminating\", pointing out that many had been backed up, recovered, and made available to the police. \nThe threats to the security of Rebekah Brooks's emails were \"believed to be genuine and were not devised as part of an alleged 'cover-up'\", the court documents said.

        "content": "Riot police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon into crowds protesting against a bill seen by the opposition as targeting media freedoms.\nThousands waving Georgian and European Union flags gathered outside parliament for a second night to protest what they see as a Russian-inspired law.\nMPs approved the second reading of the controversial \"foreign agent\" bill on Wednesday.\nThe EU warns it could harm Tbilisi's ambitions of joining the bloc.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday she was following events in Georgia with \"great concern\".  \"The Georgian people want a European future for their country. Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\" she posted on X.\nProtesters fear that the proposed foreign influence bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.\nOpponents say the measures are inspired by authoritarian legislation that neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. The billionaire founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, claimed this week that a Western \"global war\" party was using the country as part of its confrontation with Russia.\nA similar authoritarian law that came into force in Russia in 2012 has since been used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups.\nThe bill cleared its second reading with a vote of 83 to 23. After a third reading it has to be signed off by President Salome Zurabishvili, who has vowed to veto the bill, although Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her.\nThe governing party wants the law enacted by the end of the month. Once that happens, organisations would be required to state whether they are funded from abroad.\nGeorgia has been rocked by weeks of protests over the issue. On Tuesday night, there were similar clashes between police and protesters on Rustaveli Avenue, outside parliament.\nSeveral people were injured, including Levan Khabeishvili, chairman of the main opposition party United National Movement (UNM). He posted a picture of his bruised face on social media and later appeared in parliament, his face heavily bandaged.\nEyewitnesses accused some police officers of physically attacking protesters and EU foreign police chief Josep Borrell said he strongly condemned violence against Georgians \"who were peacefully demonstrating against the law on foreign influence\".\nDeputy interior minister Aleksandre Darakhvelidze said six officers were hurt and 63 people arrested and he complained that \"the rally turned completely violent\". He said Mr Khabeishvili had been hurt while trying to break through a police cordon, although his party said he had been beaten by police.\nGeorgia was granted EU candidate status last December and polls suggest about 80% of the population is in favour of joining. \nProtests against the bill began in mid-April, with many Georgians fearing the government's measures would derail Georgia from its path towards membership, says the BBC's South Caucasus correspondent, Rayhan Demytrie.\nUnder the proposals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and independent media would be required to register as organisations \"bearing the interests of a foreign power\", if they receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors.\nThey would also be monitored by Georgia's justice ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 Georgian lari ($9,400; £7,500).\nA number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is \"incompatible\" with European norms and values.\nBut the government of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. \nMr Kobakhidze has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting \"gay propaganda\" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. \nThe government insists the bill is about ensuring transparency and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. \nOn Monday, Bidzina Ivanishvili told a rally of Georgian Dream supporters that foreign-funded NGOs threatened Georgian sovereignty and that the opposition UNM would be punished for crimes against the state after this year's elections.\nPresident Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, described the pro-government rally as a \"Putin-type\" event.\nMs Zourabichvili, who is strongly opposed to the foreign influence bill, has appealed to the interior ministry to stop using \"disproportionate force\" against protesters.",

        "content": "Florida's six-week abortion ban has come into force, closing the door - for now - on the last major abortion access point in the US South. \nAnti-abortion campaigners have celebrated the new legislation - which replaces an existing 15-week law - as the gold standard of abortion policy and a major victory in the country's battle over abortion access. \nBut pro-choice campaigners say the ban will push an overstretched system to the brink. \nThey worry the new law in Florida, which had been the last state in the region without a near-total ban, will effectively cut off abortion access for more than 21 million women of reproductive age across nearly a dozen states.\n\"This essentially creates an abortion desert in the south-east part of our country,\" said Michelle Quesada, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. \"This will be devastating.\" \nAnd, activists say, the near-total ban will put women's health at risk, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states like Texas. And, activists say, the near-total ban will put women's health at risk, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states like Texas. \nBut the change may be undone as soon as November, when Floridians will vote on a ballot measure known as Amendment 4, which could protect abortion access until around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nBoth the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.Both the new ban and the looming vote have set up perhaps the highest-stakes abortion fight since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and rescinded the nationwide right to abortion.\nAfter that landmark ruling in June 2022, most Republican-controlled states moved to restrict abortion outright or at six weeks gestation, a point at which many women do not yet know they are pregnant. \nFlorida was an outlier. \nAbortion there was legal until 15 weeks, making it a relative haven for women seeking the procedure in the region. \nAfter Roe v Wade was overturned, Florida became \"one of the main points of access for abortion care within the formal healthcare system in the south\", said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute.\nMore than 84,000 abortions took place in Florida last year - a 12% jump from 2020.\nMore than half of that increase is attributed to out-of-state patients, Mr Maddow-Zimmet said, an estimated 9,000 people in 2023 alone.  \nFlorida's new law restricts abortions after six weeks from the date of a woman's last menstrual period. \nPatients must also appear for two in-person appointments spaced at least 24-hours apart - a requirement that providers say will be a challenge in an already restrictive time window. \nThe new law \"makes it virtually impossible for people to be able to access care in time\", said Daniela Martins, a spokeswoman for the Women's Emergency Network (WEM), an abortion fund in south Florida.\nThe law includes limited exceptions for victims of rape, incest, or human trafficking up until 15 weeks of pregnancy, with patients required to show documentation such as medical records or a police report. It also includes exceptions for fatal foetal abnormalities and for the life of the mother.\nAbortion providers and campaigners say that many patients will fall through the cracks - that they will either be unable to travel hundreds of miles to an appointment or unable find one in already overcrowded clinics in Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois, which are now some of the nearest states where abortion is broadly available. \n\"There's nowhere that can absorb all of the patients that we see [in Florida], it's just not possible,\" said Amber Gavin, vice-president of advocacy at A Woman's Choice, an independent abortion clinic with a location in Jacksonville.\nThe new law has been welcomed by anti-abortion activists and leading state Republicans, who had lamented Florida becoming a hub for out-of-state patients.\n\"We don't want to be an abortion tourism destination,\" Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said last year. His office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. \nMr DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law last April, but it was held up by legal challenges until last month, when a state supreme court ruling cleared the way for its enforcement. \nMatt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel told the BBC that the state could now be \"a sanctuary for life\".\n\"This is a great day for protecting unborn children,\" he said. \nMr Staver emphasised that the six-week law also includes $30m (£24m) allocated each year to support pregnant women and new mothers, money that will go towards baby formula, car seats, adoption and parenting classes.\n\"Florida is putting its money where its mouth is and protecting mothers and their children,\" he said.  \nAccording to March of Dimes, a non-partisan maternal health non-profit, pregnant women in Florida \"have a very high vulnerability\" to poor outcomes, with nearly a quarter of all expectant mothers receiving \"inadequate\" prenatal care.  \nBut a second ruling from the Florida Supreme Court means the ban might be temporary. \nOn the same day as the court green-lit the six-week ban, it approved a ballot question that will ask voters whether to amend the state constitution to protect abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nSupporters of Amendment 4 have cited internal polls suggesting it has the backing of more than 60% of Florida's voters - the threshold required to for it to pass. \nAnd all seven abortion ballot initiatives held in other states in the months since Roe was overturned have been successful, though most required a lower threshold and passed by just a simple majority. \nBoth anti-abortion and pro-choice activists have launched sweeping get-out-the-vote efforts, hoping to round up enough support before the November vote. \n\"The next several months are going to be very critical,\" said Liberty Counsel's Mr Staver. \"Everything is on the line with this amendment, it's a fight for life.\" \nPro-choice campaigners have warned that, even if Amendment 4 is passed in November, there will still have been women forced to carry unwanted or unsafe pregnancies.\nMichelle Quesada, of Planned Parenthood, said it is likely some of the state's clinics also will be forced to close, pushing physicians out of the state. \n\"It just means less access and less options for Floridians,\" she said. \"This is devastating.\"",

        "content": "The union for senior civil servants is launching an unprecedented legal challenge to ministers' Rwanda plan. \nThe FDA said it was intervening because it feared the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda could force officials to break the law.  \nUnder a new law, ministers can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and direct officials to organise flights. \nThe union wants the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position. \nThe FDA fears civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law, would put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code. \nThe government said advice from Darren Tierney, its head of propriety and ethics, says the code would not be breached. \nIn a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.In a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: \"In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.\n\"They would be operating in compliance with the law, which is the law enacted by Parliament under which the minister's specifically recognised and confirmed discretion would be exercised.\" \nThe Rwanda plan is the key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies. \nThe Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.The Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.\nIt also limits what kind of legal challenges they can present to the courts and, crucially, says ministers could choose to ignore a temporary order from the European Court of Human Rights to halt flights while a case is still being considered. \nIn practice, that would see ministers ordering key civil service leaders to prepare and send off flights, even if judges have said the case has not been settled. \nThe First Division Association (FDA), which represents those Whitehall leaders, said that measure means members fear they could be ordered to break both international law and the Civil Service Code, their legally-underpinned rule book.\nDave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said its members were not taking a political view on whether the Rwanda plan was right or wrong - but they needed certainty about whether the measure places them in a conflict between ministers and the law.\n\"This [measure] is not an accident or down to poor drafting,\" he said.\n\"It's a political choice from the government, made not for the good of the country but to avoid upsetting either of the warring factions within its own party.\"\n\"It's also irresponsible. Civil servants know that they have to support the government of the day and implement policy, regardless of their political beliefs, but they also know they have a legal obligation to adhere to the Civil Service Code. \n\"Faced with a government that is prepared to act in this cowardly, reckless way, it is left to the FDA to defend our members and the integrity of the civil service.\"\nThe FDA will now ask the High Court to prioritise its case - but there is no guarantee that judges will do so. \nBut if the case goes to a full hearing - even though no departure dates have yet been set - it could temporarily paralyse the policy. \nIn a worst case scenario, judges could rule that the government has created an unlawful conflict that then prevents top civil servants from implementing the plan. \nEarlier on Wednesday, the Home Office confirmed \"a series of nationwide operations\" was under way to detain people across the country ahead of their removal to Rwanda. \nPhotographs and a video were released of immigration enforcement officers detaining several migrants at different residences, before they were led away in handcuffs and put into secure vehicles.\nEach person being considered for forcible removal to Rwanda must be given at least seven days' written notice of that intention and they have the right to launch a legal challenge.\nThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks. \nLabour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. \nHowever, asked several times whether the party would release those detained as part of the policy, Labour's deputy nation campaign coordinator Ellie Reeves would not say.\n\"We want to get people back to their own countries if their claims have failed which is why we would set up those return agreements and also recruit a thousand case workers,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \nLabour have said they would allow those who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum, something current arrivals are barred from doing.\nThe party added that no flights to Rwanda carrying asylum seekers would be scheduled by a Labour government.\nBut this does mean any already scheduled before the election, for departure afterwards, could still leave.\nThe precise nature of how Labour plan to handle the small boats issue is now the subject of considerable scrutiny, with the general election drawing closer and the legal framework it would inherit if it wins much clearer than it was.\nOn Monday it emerged that most of the asylum seekers initially earmarked for deportation to Rwanda could not be immediately located. On Monday it emerged that most of the asylum seekers initially earmarked for deportation to Rwanda could not be immediately located. \nHome Office documents show 5,700 asylum seekers have been identified in the initial cohort to be sent to Rwanda, but only \"2,143 continue to report to the Home Office and can be located for detention\".\nNo 10 said it was \"not accurate\" to say the Home Office was unable to locate the others, but a government source admitted it was possible some could abscond before they were detained.\nThe Home Office said it had increased detention capacity to more than 2,200 spaces and had 500 highly-trained escorts ready. \nThe department said commercial charters had also been booked and an airport had been put on standby. \nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"The government's move to detain people is causing fear, distress and great anxiety amongst men, women and children who have fled war and persecution to reach safety in the UK.\"\nHe said the government should focus on processing asylum claims \"efficiently and fairly\", rather than \"headline-grabbing schemes that will waste time and resources\".\nIt comes as figures showed 268 people arrived in the UK across the English Channel in five boats on Tuesday.\nA total of 7,567 people made the journey from January to April, provisional Home Office figures show.\nThe figure is 27% higher than the number of arrivals recorded in the same period last year. \nMeanwhile, a first failed asylum seeker has gone to Rwanda under a separate voluntary removals programme. \nUnder the scheme, announced in March, migrants whose claims are rejected are offered up to £3,000 to move to the east African country.\nThe Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.The Sun, which first reported the story, said the unnamed man was flown out of the UK on Monday on a commercial flight.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called news of the voluntary return a \"pre-election gimmick,\" adding taxpayers were \"forking out £3,000 for a volunteer to board a plane\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"They've had to pay someone £3,000. There's a suspicion out there that this is about an election - it's not about seriously stopping the boats.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jennifer McKiernan and Becky Morton",

        "content": "US author Paul Auster, who wrote the New York Trilogy mystery novels, has died at the age of 77.Auster wrote more than 30 books across his career and gained cult status in the 1980s and 90s.His novels were often existentialist stories about outsiders, and were particularly successful in Europe.The writer died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn due to complications from lung cancer, his friend and fellow author Jacki Lyden confirmed.In March 2023, Auster's wife, author Siri Hustvedt, announced he had been diagnosed with cancer.\nThe son of Jewish Polish immigrants, Auster grew up in Newark, New Jersey, later moving to New York to attend Columbia University.After graduating, he spent four years in France, where he honed his craft as a writer.The sudden death of his father prompted Auster to write 1982's The Invention of Solitude, a haunting reflection on father-son relationships, which became a recurring theme.But his breakthrough came with The New York Trilogy, a philosophical twist on the detective genre centred on a shady quartet of private investigators named Blue, Brown, Black and White.His subsequent novels included Timbuktu and existential capers Moon Palace, The Music of Chance and Leviathan.Auster was praised for his sharp dialogue, and his books have been translated into more than 40 languages. In addition, Auster wrote the screenplay for 1995's Smoke, a film about a Brooklyn tobacco shop, starring Harvey Keitel, which won the writer an Independent Spirit Award.He also co-directed the follow-up, Blue in the Face, which starred Keitel again.In 2017, Auster published 866-page novel 4321, which charted US society through the life of an everyman, Archie Ferguson.The author was said to have considered it his masterwork, although it received mixed reviews from critics.Last year, Auster published Bloodbath Nation along with his photographer son-in-law Spencer Ostrander, which focused on gun violence in America.Auster's text was accompanied by Ostrander's black-and-white pictures from the sites of 30 mass shootings.In recent years, Auster's own life was struck by tragedy, with his 10-month-old granddaughter Ruby dying after ingesting heroin and his son Daniel, the child's father, dying of an overdose 10 months later.Prior to his death, Daniel had been found guilty of negligent homicide. Auster never publicly discussed their deaths.",

        "content": "Just as the Tuesday morning rush hour and school run got under way, the quiet residential streets of a north-east London suburb were overtaken by panic and screams.\nIn the space of less than half an hour in Hainault, schoolboy Daniel Anjorin and four other people were attacked. \nA few hours later, police confirmed the 14-year-old had died of his injuries.\nWitnesses captured footage of a man prowling the streets brandishing a samurai-style sword, as residents were warned to lock their doors.\nOn Wednesday evening, police named Marcus Aurelio Arduini Monzo as the suspect and charged him with murder.\nPolice have described the incident as \"truly horrific\" and are still piecing together how and why this attack unfolded.\nShortly before 07:00 BST on Tuesday morning, police received reports of a car being driven into a house near Hainault's Underground rail station.\nOne witness told PA news agency he heard shrieking and police officers confronting the suspect.\nHe continued: \"I looked out the back window because the noise was coming from back there, I saw a bloke dressed in yellow jumping over some fences... I saw a policeman and policewoman - normal coppers with the short-sleeved shirts - who chased after him and they were shouting for him to put it down.\"\nManpreet Singh told the BBC he saw a \"group of people, five or six of them, trying to fight off a guy - he had a sword in his hand\".\nHe told Radio 5 Live he saw the man running towards Hainault's nearby Underground station and entering a road opposite, before trying to get into a house.\nMr Singh said the man was trying to fight police officers off and was Tasered.\nEyewitness James Fernando said a grey transit van pulled up and a \"man a got out with a samurai sword\". The man tried to talk to one female resident who ran away from him, he continued.\nHe said that as the man pulled the sword into the air, the woman tried to warn another neighbour who turned around, only to be \"struck in the head\".\nThe man \"was running around, still after the police officers came, with the sword in his hand\", Mr Fernando added.\nIn one video, the suspect can be seen looking in houses along Laing Close, near where a motionless person was also seen lying in the road.\nOne member of the public appears to have had a lucky escape. Footage captured the moment they emerged from a house into which the man had been looking moments before.\nThey can be seen poking their head out the door and seeing the attacker, before quickly disappearing back inside.\nAnother member of the public captured footage of the man being pursued by police as he climbed over fences and garages and into gardens.\nA man can be heard warning residents by screaming \"everybody lock your doors\".\nPolice say they arrested a suspect 22 minutes after they received the first 999 call from a member of the public.\nThere were five victims in total, one of whom - 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin - died of his wounds. Two of those injured were police officers.\nDaniel was a pupil at Bancroft's school, in Woodford Green, east London. The school was also attended by Grace O'Malley-Kumar, who died in a knife attack in Nottingham - where she was studying at university - in June 2023.\nA tribute to Daniel posted on the school's website read: \"He was a true scholar, demonstrating commendable dedication to his academic pursuits. \n\"His positive nature and gentle character will leave a lasting impact on us. Losing such a young pupil is something we will always struggle to come to terms with.\"\nThe other four victims are all expected to survive their injuries.\nA 33-year-old man was injured when a van driven by the man hit him and slammed into a home in Laing Close.\nHe then suffered a wound to his neck after a further attack.\nAnother member of the public, a 35-year-old man, suffered slash wounds to his arm when he was \"attacked inside a nearby property\".\nTwo Metropolitan Police officers who were injured have \"significant but not life-threatening\" injuries and require surgery, the Met confirmed.\nOn Wednesday, Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley confirmed a male officer sustained serious hand injuries and a female officer underwent several hours of surgery to repair \"horrifically serious\" wounds to her arm.\nAmbulance crews, specialist critical care paramedics and London's Air ambulance treated the five people \"with a variety of injuries\" before taking them all to hospital, where the boy later died.\nPolice arrested a 36-year-old man at the scene.\nOn Wednesday, he was in police custody after spending time in hospital where he was treated for his injuries.\nThat evening, police named the man as Marcus Aurelio Arduini Monzo and charged him with the murder of Daniel.\nHe was also charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article, police announced.\nThe suspect, who is a dual Spanish-Brazilian national, will appear at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on Thursday.\nNo. The Met Police said within hours of the incident that it \"does not appear to be terror-related\" and also said they did not believe it was a \"targeted attack\".\nPolice have also said they are not looking for any more suspects and there is no ongoing risk to the public.\nThe incident occurred in Hainault, a suburban area in Ilford, which is part of the London Borough of Redbridge. \nHainault is part of Greater London and is around 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the capital.\nBy Wednesday evening, police had removed the cordon at the scene, granting access to pedestrians for the first time since the attack. \nDo you live or work in Hainault?

After retiring from tennis in 1999, he commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC and turned his hand to coaching, working with Novak Djokovic.He moved to London in 2012, and his bankruptcy stemmed from an unpaid loan of more than £3m on a luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain.Although bankruptcy orders end after a year in England and Wales, a judge suspended the automatic discharge of the order in 2018 because Becker was \"failing to comply with his obligations\".Lawyers for Becker last month asked a judge to lift the suspension saying he had done \"the best possible he is capable of doing\".\nGiving written reasons for his decision, Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Nicholas Briggs said said it would be \"perverse\" not to lift the suspension now.Giving written reasons for his decision, Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Nicholas Briggs said said it would be \"perverse\" not to lift the suspension now.He said: \"On the spectrum of bankrupts who range from 'difficult as possible and doing everything to frustrate the trustee's inquiries' to 'co-operative, providing information and delivering up assets', Mr Becker clearly falls on the right side of the line.\"The judge said an \"unresolved matter\" was the location of some of Becker's trophies that are missing. He noted Becker has no further information relating to the whereabouts of the trophies but did not object them being minted or monetised.The judge said: \"As the joint trustees are concerned to realise and distribute assets this offer provides a commercial outcome.\"Louis Doyle KC for Becker told the court the settlement agreement\" affects a compromise of all outstanding matters in the bankruptcy although that is predicated on Mr Becker making payment which will have the effect of providing a substantial sum into the bankruptcy estate\".He said the resolution with the trustees includes the \"outstanding trophies\" and that Becker \"can't do more than he has done to bring us to this point\".Becker was jailed for two-and-a-half years in April 2022 at Southwark Crown Court  after being found guilty of four offences.He was acquitted of 25 other charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career.",

It is unclear whether police made any arrests. \nGovernor Newsom condemned the violence in a post on X, formerly Twitter, separate to his office's statement. \n\"The law is clear,\" he said. \"The right to free speech does not extend to inciting violence, vandalism or lawlessness.\"\nHe said those responsible \"must be held accountable... including through criminal prosecution, suspension, or expulsion\".\nCiting law enforcement sources, the Los Angeles Times reports there were only a few UCLA police officers on hand and they retreated because they were outnumbered by the crowd.Citing law enforcement sources, the Los Angeles Times reports there were only a few UCLA police officers on hand and they retreated because they were outnumbered by the crowd.\nAccording to the newspaper, reinforcements were called from California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles and it took three hours to bring the situation under control.\nThe overnight clash at one of America's top public colleges took place only hours after police in New York City raided and cleared a Columbia University building taken over by students.\nProtests at Columbia against the war in Gaza have inspired similar actions at universities - small and large, public and private - in more than two dozen states, with activists demanding that institutions cut financial ties with Israel and companies profiting from the war.\nOn Wednesday, state troopers arrested 17 anti-war protesters at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the BBC's Tom Bateman on campus, while the NYPD arrested at least 15 people at Fordham University in the Bronx. \nUCLA cancelled classes on Wednesday, as it sought to ease tensions on the central quad of its Westwood campus.\nMary Osako, a UCLA vice-chancellor, said police and other first responders were called to the scene of its encampment over \"horrific acts of violence\" early on Wednesday morning.\n\"We are sickened by this senseless violence and it must end,\" she said.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass slammed the clashes as \"absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable\". Speaking later on Wednesday, she called for an investigation into the violence. \n\"Those involved in launching fireworks at other people, spraying chemicals and physically assaulting others will be found, arrested and prosecuted, as well as anyone involved in any form of violence or lawlessness,\" she said. \nBy morning, a tight security cordon was in place as a handful of protesters fortified their encampment.\nIt remains unclear how many of the people involved in the night-time chaos, particularly on the pro-Israeli side, are students at the university.\nThe Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations blamed the violence on a \"mob of pro-Israel extremists\".\nMeanwhile, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles sought to distance itself from the violence, but blamed the university's chancellor for allowing \"an environment to be created over many months that has made students feel unsafe\".\n\"The abhorrent actions of a few counterprotesters last night do not represent the Jewish community or our values,\" the group wrote. \"We believe in peaceful, civic discourse.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said several out of some 300 arrests at two New York campuses had been \"outside agitators\".\nPressure has been mounting on college leaders to rein in pro-Palestinian protests as they spread across the country.\nBut University of California leaders had sought to pursue a more light-touch approach to the demonstrations that colleagues across the country. \nCollege guidance to managing protests changed in 2011, after heavy handed policing during a demonstration on campus sparked outrage.

The situation's probably never been as bad as it is now.\"I think it's really important that children get involved in creating this app, otherwise the message is often coming from adults and it can be a bit patronising, a bit preachy.\"\nHeadteacher Cristina Taboada-Naya said the app was important because her staff could not keep an eye on the children when they were not in school.\"Whilst they're here, they're safe and we know how to keep them safe, we can give them constant reminders and prompts,\" she said. \"In the electronic age, it is outside of that time that we are less able to protect them - so we have to arm them with the knowledge and tools and resources to keep themselves safe and the app allows them to do that.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

        "description": "Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina. ",
        "content": "Earlier this year, Ai Qing was woken up in the middle of the night by angry chants outside her dormitory in northern Argentina. \nShe peered out of the window to see Argentine workers surrounding the compound and blockading the entrance with flaming tyres. \n\"It was getting scary because I could see the sky being lit up by the fire. It had become a riot,\" says Ms Ai, who works for a Chinese company extracting lithium from salt flats in the Andes mountains, for use in batteries. \nThe protest, sparked by the firing of a number of Argentine staff, is just one of a growing number of cases of friction between Chinese businesses and host communities, as China - which already dominates the processing of minerals vital to the green economy - expands its involvement in mining them.  \nIt was just 10 years ago that a Chinese company bought the country's first stake in an extraction project within the \"lithium triangle\" of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which holds most of the world's lithium reserves. \nMany further Chinese investments in local mining operations have followed, according to mining publications, and corporate, government and media reports. The BBC calculates that based on their shareholdings, Chinese companies now control an estimated 33% of the lithium at projects currently producing the mineral or those under construction. \nBut as Chinese businesses have expanded, they have faced allegations of abuses similar to those often levelled at other international mining giants. \nFor Ai Qing, the tyre-burning protest was a rude awakening. She had expected a quiet life in Argentina, but found herself involved in conflict mediation because of her knowledge of Spanish. \n\"It wasn't easy,\" she says. \n\"Beyond the language, we have to tone down many things, like how management thinks the employees are simply lazy and too reliant on the union, and how locals think Chinese people are only here to exploit them.\" \nThe BBC Global China Unit has identified at least 62 mining projects across the world, in which Chinese companies have a stake, that are designed to extract either lithium or one of three other minerals key to green technologies - cobalt, nickel and manganese. \nAll are used to make lithium-ion batteries - used in electric vehicles - which, along with solar panels, are now high industrial priorities for China. Some projects are among the largest producers of these minerals in the world.  \nChina has long been a leader in refining lithium and cobalt, with a share of global supply reaching 72% and 68% respectively in 2022, according to the Chatham House think tank. \nIts capacity to refine these and other critical minerals has helped the country reach a point where it made more than half of the electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2023, has 60% of the global manufacturing capacity for wind turbines, and controls at least 80% of each stage in the solar panel supply chain.   \nChina's role in the sector has made these items cheaper and more accessible globally. \nBut it's not only China that will need to mine and process minerals needed for the green economy. The UN says that if the world is to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, their use must increase six-fold by 2040. \nThe US, the UK and the European Union have all developed strategies, meanwhile, to reduce their dependence on Chinese supplies.  \nAs Chinese companies have increased their overseas mining operations, allegations of problems caused by these projects have steadily risen. \nThe Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, an NGO, says such troubles are \"not unique to Chinese mining\" but last year it published a report listing 102 allegations made against Chinese companies involved in extracting critical minerals, ranging from violations of the rights of local communities to damage to ecosystems and unsafe working conditions.  \nThese allegations dated from 2021 and 2022. The BBC has counted more than 40 further allegations that were made in 2023, and reported by NGOs or in the media.  \nPeople in two countries, on opposite sides of the world, also told us their stories.  \nOn the outskirts of Lubumbashi in the far south of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Christophe Kabwita has been leading opposition to the Ruashi cobalt mine, owned by the Jinchuan Group since 2011. \nHe says the open-pit mine, situated 500m from his doorstep, blights people's lives by using explosives to blast away at the rock two or three times per week. Sirens wail when the blasting is about to start, as a signal for everyone to stop what they are doing and take cover.  \n\"Whatever the temperature, whether it's raining or a gale is blowing, we have to leave our homes and go to a shelter near the mine,\" he says. \nThis applies to everyone, including the sick and women who have just given birth, he adds, as nowhere else is safe. \nIn 2017 a teenage girl, Katty Kabazo, was reportedly killed by a flying rock on her way home from school, while other rocks are said to have punched holes into the walls and roofs of local houses. \nA spokesperson from the Ruashi mine, Elisa Kalasa, acknowledged that \"one young kid was in that area - she was not supposed to be there and was affected by the flying rocks\".    \nShe said that since then \"we have improved the technology, and now we have the sort of blasting where there are no flying rocks any more\".  \nHowever, the BBC spoke to a processing manager at the company, Patrick Tshisand, who appeared to give a different picture. He said: \"If we mine, we use explosives. Explosives can cause flying rocks, which can end up in the community because the community is too close to the mine... so we had several accidents like that.\"    \nMs Kalasa also said that between 2006 and 2012 the company compensated more than 300 families to relocate further away from the mine. \nOn Indonesia's remote Obi Island, a mine jointly owned by a Chinese company, Lygend Resources and Technology, and Indonesian mining giant Harita Group has rapidly swallowed up the forests around the village of Kawasi.   \nJatam, a local mining watchdog, says that villagers have been under pressure to move and accept government compensation. Dozens of families have refused to relocate, saying what is on offer is below market value. As a result, some say they have been threatened with legal action for allegedly disrupting a project of national strategic importance.   \nJatam says old-growth forests have been logged to make way for the mine and they've documented how the rivers and ocean have been filled with sediment, polluting what was once a pristine marine environment.    \n\"The water from the river is undrinkable now, it's so contaminated, and the sea, that is usually clear blue, turns red when it rains,\" Nur Hayati, a teacher who lives in Kawasi village, says.     \nIndonesian soldiers have been deployed to the island to protect the mine and when the BBC visited recently, there was a noticeable, increased military presence. Jatam claims soldiers are being used to intimidate, and even assault, people who speak out against the mine. Ms Nur says her community feels the army is there to \"protect the interests of the mine, not the welfare of their own people\". \nThe military's spokesperson in Jakarta said allegations of intimidation \"cannot be proven\" and that while the soldiers were there to \"protect the mine\" they were not there to \"directly interact with locals\".  \nIn a statement, he claimed the relocation of villagers to make way for the mine had been overseen by the police in a \"peaceful and smooth manner\".  \nMs Nur was among a group of villagers who travelled to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, in June 2018, to protest against the impact of the mine. But a local government representative, Samsu Abubakar, told the BBC no complaints had been received from the public about environmental damage.    \nHe also shared an official report that concluded Harita Group had been \"compliant with environmental management and monitoring obligations\".    \nHarita itself told us that it \"adheres strictly to ethical business practices and local laws\" and it is \"continuously working to address and mitigate any negative impacts\". \nIt claimed it had not caused widespread deforestation, it monitored the local source of drinking water, and independent tests have confirmed the water met government quality standards. It added that it had not carried out forced evictions or unfair land transactions and had not intimidated anyone.    \nA year ago, the Chinese mining trade body, known as CCCMC, started setting up a grievance mechanism, intended to resolve complaints made against Chinese-owned mining projects. The companies themselves \"lack the ability - both cultural and linguistic\" to interact with local communities or civil society organisations, says a spokesperson, Lelia Li.  \nHowever, the mechanism still isn't fully operating. \nMeanwhile, China's involvement in foreign mining operations seems certain to increase. It's not just a \"geopolitical play\" to control a key market, says Aditya Lolla, the Asia programme director at Ember, a UK-based environmental think tank, it also makes sense from a business perspective.  \n\"Acquisitions are being made by Chinese companies because, for them, it's all about profits,\" he says. \nAs a result, Chinese workers will continue to be sent to mining projects around the world and for them, these projects mostly present a chance to earn good money. \nPeople such as Wang Gang, who has worked for 10 years in Chinese-owned cobalt mines in DR Congo. The 48-year-old lives in company accommodation and eats in the staff canteen, working 10-hour days, seven days a week, with four days' leave per month.  \nHe accepts the separation from his family in Hubei province, because he earns more than he could at home. He also enjoys the clear skies and tall forests of DR Congo.  \nHe communicates with local mine workers in a mixture of French, Swahili, and English, but says: \"We rarely chat, except for work-related matters.\"  \nEven Ai Qing, who speaks the language of her host country fluently, has little interaction with Argentines outside work. She's started seeing a fellow Chinese worker, and they mostly hang out with other people like themselves - being thousands of miles from home pulls everyone closer.  \nA highlight for her is visiting the salt flats high up in the Andes where the lithium is mined and life is \"chill\".   \n\"The altitude sickness always gets me - I can't fall asleep and I can't eat,\" she says. \"But I really do enjoy going up there because things are much simpler, and there are no office politics.\"  \nAi Qing and Wang Gang are pseudonyms \nAdditional reporting by Emery Makumeno, Byobe Malenga, Lucien Kahozy",

In the US, consumer prices rose 3.5% over the 12 months to March.That is down sharply from the 9.1% rate seen in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target, ticking higher in recent months. In its statement announcing its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed drew attention to those trends, noting \"a lack of further progress\" bringing inflation back to its goal.\"The statement explicitly recognises the recent deterioration in inflation dynamics,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.\"Patience is the watchword now for the Fed and the risk of fewer or no rate cuts this year is growing.\" The Fed has left rates untouched since last July, after boosting them aggressively from near zero in March 2022.Higher interest rates trickle out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, car and business loans and other debt.The Fed's moves are being closely watched around the world where many central banks, including the Bank of England, have also had a prolonged period of sharply raised rates. Mr Powell said policymakers in other countries may move more quickly than the US to cut rates due to worries about economic slowdown.\"The difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is they're just not having the kind of growth we're having,\" he said. \"We can be patient.\"Separately, the Fed also outlined its previously-discussed plans to slow the pace at which it is shrinking its holdings of US Treasuries.It built up those holdings as part of its stimulus efforts to bolster the economy when the pandemic hit in 2020, starting to reverse the moves two years later. Mr Powell said the decision to slow that process was aimed at avoiding disruption to financial markets and not intended to influence the inflation fight.",

        "content": "Police and private security throng every entrance but one. Steel barriers line the streets. Students pack up belongings in their cars and leave for home - classes are cancelled, and exam plans are up in the air.\nEverywhere there is gloom, and uncertainty about what happens next at Columbia University in New York City.\nStudents told the BBC that the university's decision to call in police to clear a Gaza protest late on Tuesday, leading to a raid on the occupied Hamilton Hall and more than 100 arrests, has left the college community shattered.\nThe university president, Minouche Shafik, said that it was with great regret that she had ordered the police raid against students and others she said had infiltrated the protest. It would \"take time to heal\", she added in a message in the operation's aftermath.\nFor students of this prestigious school in Manhattan, how long is unclear.\n\"It definitely feels like things are scattered,\" said Anna Oakes, a graduate journalism student at Columbia University who covered the removal of protesters from Hamilton Hall on Tuesday evening. \"There's this feeling of scramble in the aftermath.\"\nAfter a night of chaos and confrontation, the clearest reminder of the protests on Wednesday morning was water-logged flyers littering streets alongside the campus perimeter. One said that protest organisers \"will not stop. We will not rest\". \nStudents who remained said they were in the dark about plans for their finals and even whether dining services would be brought back fully. \nWhile others speed off in cars packed with possessions, Will Parkinson, a 20-year-old environmental studies student, described his feeling: \"Weird limbo.\"\n\"We're not sure what to do,\" he said, and recounted how he watched from a friend's dorm window as police stormed Hamilton Hall. \nHe had been barred from leaving the building during the raid, which meant he was unable to get home and finish a term paper. \nMr Parkinson said Columbia had given students money to spend at nearby restaurants because they had to limit staff who would normally operate the university's cafeterias. \nHe had left campus to eat, and was not sure when he would eventually write that paper. \nOthers continued to peacefully protest, walking near the new steel barriers, holding slogans including \"Cops off campus\" and \"Student power v Israel power\". \nMembers of the faculty, whose access to campus and offices is now largely denied, said they did not know how they were expected to conclude the semester.\n\"I have students who can't get to their work study to pay for school, I have faculty members with papers they need to grade locked in their offices, I have 16 instructors looking to me for guidance on how to support students through finals and the end of the semester,\" said Joseph Howley, a classics professor who has worked with the student protesters. \n\"So it has completely upended everything we do.\" \nUnable to address those academic obligations, Prof Howley led dozens of students and faculty members in a protest outside the one campus entrance left unobstructed on Wednesday afternoon. \nHe and others said that the university administration had lost their trust by bringing police on to campus, and that they shouted \"shame\" in unison when Dr Shafik's name was mentioned. \nOne unidentified speaker at the protest said she was at Hamilton Hall when police \"ambushed us. We were tackled and beaten, and my hands were handcuffed so tightly that even lifting my pinky caused extreme harm and excruciating pain\".\nThe NYPD denied that it was unnecessarily aggressive, and the administration has defended its decision to bring in police - who will remain on campus until 17 May. \nMeghnad Bose, a 31-year-old journalism graduate student at Columbia University, witnessed the NYPD raid on Tuesday night and said police acted \"rough and aggressive\" with the protesters.\nWhile 109 people at Columbia University were arrested when police stormed the school to quash the pro-Palestinian protest, police said at a Wednesday press conference that they arrested another 173 people at a similar sit-in at the City College of New York later in the evening.\nPolice Commissioner Edward Caban said officers intervened because \"public safety was a real concern... the NYPD was called in to do their job\".\nA 19-year-old physics student named Kevin - he declined to give his last name - said it was \"difficult to be proud of being a Columbia student\" after the police raid, which had left him deeply frustrated. \nHe spoke while piling bags full of clothes into his parents' car just outside the campus gates, and said he was unsure when he would return. \n\"It depends on what the university does in the coming months,\" he said. \"We'll see what they [the administration] say about it. The ball is in their court.\"\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

Using so called Terahertz (THz) waves, with some early trials on patients already underway, the hope is to speed up surgery and help surgeons remove cancers while leaving as much healthy skin as possible.THz waves fall between infrared (used in remote controls) and microwaves on the electromagnetic spectrum. They can be used in scans to map the extent of tumours more accurately.\nScientists actually refer to the terahertz \"gap\" as it is a bit of the spectrum which we have a hard time actually generating and using the waves found there.That has started to change in the last few years, and as we have learned to make THz waves we can start to find uses for them. That is what the research at Warwick is all about.\nProf Emma MacPherson showed me round her lab and demonstrated how THz waves are now being used to detect skin cancer.She explained THz waves were \"a million times lower frequency than X-rays so it's really safe and it's really sensitive to subtle changes in water concentration\".In skin cancers, the amount of water in the skin is different when compared to the healthy skin around it. In theory you could use a THz wave producing machine to map very accurately the extent of any skin cancer.Which is why in her lab there is a student with his trousers rolled up having green dots stuck to his legs. These show the area under investigation to a robot arm with a THz generator on the tip.The robot then scans and maps out the extent of the cancer.\nAt the moment, a surgeon will draw on years of experience and eyeball the cancer to make a decision on how much to cut out. Surgery can take hours.But if Professor MacPherson's THz trials work, doctors could instead scan the cancer first and know exactly where to cut. It could potentially both speed things up and help preserve as much healthy skin as possible.Early trials on patients have been carried out and more are planned for the summer.As well as cancer, you the same approach could be used on skin disease like eczema, to analyse the skin and work out exactly the right course of treatment.If all goes well, in five years any skin cancer patient might go for a THz scan just like a patient with a broken bone goes for an x-ray.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "content": "Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Wednesday that she will force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House.\nThe conservative firebrand filed the motion last month but held off on formally introducing it, which would require a vote on Mr Johnson's fate within two legislative days.\nAt the time, she described her action as a warning to the Republican leader. \nNow she has followed through on that threat.\nSpeaker Johnson put out a statement that her motion \"is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country\".\nMr Johnson's support for a $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, approved by the House on 20 April, is partially responsible for Ms Greene forcing the vote.\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"He has proven it over and over again.\"\nOn Tuesday, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives pledged to support Mr Johnson if his leadership was threatened - a show of gratitude for the speaker's co-operation on Ukraine aid, which was a priority for Democrats and President Joe Biden.\nMs Greene called the Democratic pledge \"a warm hug and a big wet sloppy kiss\" for the speaker.\nRepublican leaders, including former president Donald Trump, had reportedly pressured the Georgia congresswoman to back down from attempting to remove Mr Johnson, concerned that a Republican power struggle would harm the party's prospects in November's general election.\nLast October, Democrats voted with a handful of Republicans to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off three weeks of Republican discord as several top candidates failed to win the near-unanimous party support needed to secure the gavel.\nMr Johnson ultimately prevailed -  in part because he was relatively unknown and had few connections to party leadership. But some Republicans, including Ms Greene, soured on him after he worked with Democrats to pass government funding legislation earlier this year.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative,\" Ms Greene said on Wednesday. \"Once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognise.\"\nTwo other Republicans in the House have said they will back Ms Greene's effort, which would be enough in the narrowly divided chamber to remove the speaker with Democratic help. Instead, the Democrats have said they will vote with pro-Johnson Republicans to \"table\" the motion, effectively killing.\nMs Greene said she will introduce her motion to remove Mr Johnson next week.

        "content": "On a day off from his criminal trial in a Manhattan court, Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail with back-to-back rallies in two battleground states. \nThe Republican presidential candidate has appeared at times irritated or lethargic in court while facing charges of falsifying business records - even at one point allegedly dozing off. \nBut on Wednesday at a rally outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he seemed fired up as he spoke to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters for about an hour and a half.\nHe hit on most of his campaign's major themes - immigration, the economy, foreign policy and his opposition to President Joe Biden. \nAs he usually does on the campaign trail, he frequently ad-libbed his remarks - \"I'm 92% off teleprompter,\" he said in an implicit gibe at his Democratic rival, who he often accuses of being overly reliant on scripted remarks.\nThe former president was fined $9,000 (£7,180) this week for making derogatory public statements about people involved in the case, which revolves around a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actress who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. \nIn Wisconsin, he briefly addressed his legal troubles. \n\"I got indicted - think of it - for nothing,\" he claimed.\n\"I have a crooked judge, he's a totally conflicted judge,\" said Mr Trump, who is still free to criticise Justice Juan Merchan under the terms of his gag order. \"Unfortunately it's a 95% or so Democrat area.\" \nHe went on to criticise the other criminal indictments against him and said \"my poll numbers are higher than they've ever been\". Most recent polls show him in a very tight race with Mr Biden.  \nA new Emerson College Polling/The Hill swing state survey finds Mr Biden slightly trailing Mr Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. \nMany of Mr Trump's fans here said they believed he was being unfairly prosecuted and, echoing the candidate himself, that his criminal trial would eventually boost his standing at the polls. \n\"The trial is definitely going to increase his popularity,\" said Nancy Ridge, a supporter from nearby Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, who was wearing a jacket printed with Mr Trump's mugshot on the back and the words \"Wanted: for president\". \n\"Especially among lower-class people who have been convicted of crimes or even falsely accused. \n\"They understand the justice system and how corrupt it can be,\" she said.\n\"It's free publicity,\" said Jerry Cleppe, another Trump fan waiting in a queue outside the event. \n\"It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it's attention. The trial is a good thing.\"\nMr Trump also addressed the pro-Palestinian student protests at US colleges and said the New York Police Department \"did an incredible job\" clearing an occupied building on the campus of Columbia University on Tuesday night. \n\"To every college president I say remove the encampments immediately, vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students who want a safe place from which to learn,\" he said.\nHe also touched on abortion, in a week in which an interview with Time Magazine was seized upon by the Biden campaign as being anti-abortion rights. \nMr Trump insisted that leaving the legality of abortion up to individual states was the right thing to do and that he thought \"people are absolutely thrilled\" with a state-by-state patchwork of laws on the issue.\nAfter his rally in Wisconsin, the former president hosted another event in Michigan. He is due back in court in Manhattan on Thursday.",

        "content": "Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will face a new trial in the autumn after his state rape conviction was overturned, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\nManhattan prosecutors told the packed court: \"We believe in this case and will be retrying this case.\"\nAn appeals court ruled last week that Weinstein did not receive a fair trial in 2020.\nBut he remains jailed because of a separate rape conviction in California.\nWeinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.\nAt the court in New York on Wednesday, prosecutors said they would be ready to retry the case by September.\nAt the start of proceedings, Weinstein was brought in in a wheelchair, wearing a navy-blue suit and a light blue tie.\nHe appeared to be in good spirits, and smiled and waved to his team.\nAssistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the judge that one of Weinstein's victims was also in court. \nShe said the \"sexual assault survivor\" was there \"to show she's not backing down and is here to make sure justice is served once again. He may have power and privilege, but she has the truth.\"\nThe judge overseeing the case ruled that Weinstein's retrial will happen sometime after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September.\nLast week, the New York state appeals court ruled that the judge overseeing the former Hollywood mogul's case had erred when he allowed the testimony of women who made allegations about Weinstein for which he was never charged. \nThe judge had \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes\", the appeals court ruled by a vote of 4 to 3.\nThe decision also said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined in a way that portrayed him in a \"highly prejudicial\" light.\n\"The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial,\" the court found.\nWeinstein has always maintained his innocence and his defence team said at the time of the New York trial that sex between the movie executive and accusers was consensual.\nArthur Aidala, the movie mogul's lawyer, hailed the decision as a \"victory for every criminal defendant in the state of New York\".\nWeinstein was taken to hospital a few days ago for what his lawyer described as \"immediate medical attention\" and \"a myriad of tests\".\nHe could be sent to the city's Rikers Island prison, or possibly to California to serve time there. \nJuda Engelmawer, a spokesman for Weinstein, told BBC News that his health condition has worsened in prison, but he is elated to have had his conviction vacated. \n\"He was relieved that the court saw it the way we did - that the trial wasn't fair,\" he said outside court.\n\"But he acknowledges his long road ahead of him.\"\nMr Engelmawer added that Weinstein hopes to remain in New York pending re-trial, in order to be nearer to his family and doctors. \nIn court, his lawyer argued that despite his health issues, Weinstein is \"sharp as a tack, smart as he ever was\".\nMr Aidala said that his client had read hundreds of books, so he had no concerns about his mental ability to participate in his legal defence.\nAt his New York trial in 2020, Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years.\nMs Haleyi has said she has reservations about returning to court again to attempt to re-convict Weinstein. \n\"It was retraumatising and gruelling and exhausting and all the things,\" she said at a news conference on Friday.\n\"I definitely don't want to actually go through that again. But for the sake of keeping going and doing the right thing and because it is what happened, I would consider it.\"\nMs Haleyi did not attend Wednesday's hearing in New York, but her attorney Gloria Allred appeared in court. \nSpeaking to press after the hearing, Ms. Allred said her client was still thinking about testifying again, but \"it's not an easy decision for her.\" Prosecutors in California say Weinstein's conviction for raping a woman in 2013 will stand up to any appeals challenge.\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by over 100 women. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York and 23-year prison term galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nMr Aidala told reporters that Weinstein was \"used to champagne and caviar\" and now is paying for crisps and M&M's at the prison commissary.\nHis films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.",

        "content": "Europeans in 27 countries vote in June in elections that will have a wide impact across the European Union and beyond.\nAbout 400 million voters are eligible to vote from Finland in the north to Cyprus in the south, Ireland in the west to Bulgaria in the east.\nAt stake is the make-up of the next European Parliament, the direct link between Europeans and the EU's institutions.\nHow Europeans vote will shape the direction of the EU over the next five years, on climate change and migration, greater integration or increased nationalism.\nRight-wing and far-right parties have made significant gains across Europe, and this shift to the right is likely to be reflected in the next European Parliament. \nThe Parliament, based in Brussels and Strasbourg, passes laws that affect the lives of EU citizens and has the job of endorsing the annual budget, which this year reached €189bn (£160bn).\nThe result of the elections also has a bearing on who will be president of the European Commission.\nVoting starts on Thursday 6 June in the Netherlands, followed by Ireland and Malta on the following day and Latvia and Slovakia on Saturday. Many EU member states vote on Sunday 9 June.\nMost voting takes place on one day although Czechs have Friday and Saturday to cast their ballots, and Italians vote on Saturday and Sunday. Belgians are not just voting in European elections on Sunday, but in national and regional elections too.\nIn most EU countries you have to be 18 to vote, but if you're 16 you can vote in Germany, Austria, Belgium and Malta, while in Greece the minimum age is 17. In a handful of countries including Luxembourg and Bulgaria, voting is compulsory.In most EU countries you have to be 18 to vote, but if you're 16 you can vote in Germany, Austria, Belgium and Malta, while in Greece the minimum age is 17. In a handful of countries including Luxembourg and Bulgaria, voting is compulsory.\nResults are decided by proportional representation, so every vote counts, although some countries have a minimum electoral threshold of up to 5%. Average turnout in 2019 was 50.7%.\nBy the end of 9 June, it will be clear which parties have won the Parliament's 720 seats, 15 more than in 2019. The UK took part in the last European elections before leaving the EU, and some of its seats have since been redistributed or kept in reserve if the EU expands.\nThe number of MEPs each country has is proportionate to its population. Germany, the EU's most populous country, has 96. Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus have the minimum number of six each.\nAs the only EU institution directly elected by voters across 27 countries, it connects European citizens to the two other big institutions: the EU's executive branch - the European Commission - and the Council, which is made up of ministers from EU governments.As the only EU institution directly elected by voters across 27 countries, it connects European citizens to the two other big institutions: the EU's executive branch - the European Commission - and the Council, which is made up of ministers from EU governments.\nThe European Parliament shapes the direction of EU laws and policies by amending and passing laws and deciding on international agreements and enlargements. It must endorse the EU's annual budget, and it can ask the Commission to propose legislation. \nMEPs oversee the work of the Commission and Council. They share responsibility with the Council for adopting laws put forward by the Commission.\nMost MEPs sit in political groups ranging from left to right, rather than by nationality, so they often have juggle allegiances to party or country. \nTraditionally the two biggest are the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), but others groups have become increasingly significant.Traditionally the two biggest are the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), but others groups have become increasingly significant.\nThe liberal Renew Europe group and the Greens/European Free Alliance were the next biggest in the last parliament, but two groups on the right have set their sights on big gains.The liberal Renew Europe group and the Greens/European Free Alliance were the next biggest in the last parliament, but two groups on the right have set their sights on big gains.\nThey are the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group.

One is the smaller left-wing GUE/NGL grouping, the other is the MEPs not aligned to any group - from Hungary's nationalist Fidesz members to the handful of separatists from Spain's Catalonia region.\nAlthough the main purpose of the June election is to decide the make-up of parliament, voters often use the occasion to send a message to their national governments. \nFrom Italy to France, Austria to Belgium, Germany to the Netherlands and beyond, parties on the far right are eyeing significant gains.\nPolls suggest the two groups on the right, ECR and ID, could overtake the centre left and become the second largest force in Parliament.\nUntil now the centre right has tended to work together with the centre left but the EPP may come under pressure to seek new allies if the centre left performs badly.\nA move to the right could put the brakes on plans for new climate and sustainability laws and influence social or economic legislation. The EU's strong backing for financial and military aid for Ukraine could also be affected.\nOne of the first tasks of the new MEPs will be to elect the president of the European Commission. The current president, Ursula von der Leyen, is seeking re-election.\nThe EU's 27 heads of state or government, known as the European Council, will factor in theelection results and then nominate a candidate, whose name is then presented to the Parliament.

It wants to increase this, but faces a hurdle - soybean-based feed is currently substantially cheaper.\nSoybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; £400) per tonne, compared with €1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.Soybean feed is presently around 460 euros ($490; £400) per tonne, compared with €1,400 for insect-based, according to one European comparison earlier this year.\nTo try to reduce the price of its feed, Full Circle is now turning to AI to help maximise production at a lower cost. To do this it is training an AI system to study all available past and present data on insect farming to determine and then continuously fine tune the best methods.\nThis can include everything from temperature to food quantity, the optimum space that the larvae need, quickly and accurately counting thousands of flies, and whether to introduce new strains or species.\n\"AI can help us speed up the process of trial and error, helping us overcome obstacles, and develop a thorough enough understanding of insect production, to be reasonably confident that our production is optimised,\" says Mr Collins.\n\"AI can help us process, record and understand every attempt at insect farming to date, and expand the potential for a larger and more nutritious crop every time we grow one.\"\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nSome 5,000 miles away in Lithuania, insect farm software provider Cogastro is also working on an AI-based system. It currently sells monitoring software that automatically collects data for users to analyse, but the AI upgrade will enable to system to learn, adapt and make changes inside an insect farm for itself.\nCogastro says it is not rushing the launch of the AI, and instead plans to launch it commercially in the next three years.\nIts founder and chief executive Mante Sidlauskaite, says she is wary of companies in the space that claim they already have AI systems readily available. \"We know from our example that it takes time to develop a layer of software, and we have been here already for five years.\n\"It has taken us time to work with as many companies as possible globally, to understand the differences and similarities of their processes, so that we would be able to standardise our data models to cover their overlapping needs. So we now have a baseline to build an AI solution.\n\"But when we see start-ups coming up just yesterday, and then announcing that they have something related to AI, they cannot have an accurate AI model before they start to train it, and to train it, you need to have some data, and to have data you need to have some customers first.\"\nShe adds that she is concerned about the overuse of AI as a buzzword, without firms explaining exactly how their AI supposedly works.\nBack at Full Circle, it is developing its AI system with a Singapore-based expert in the field called Simon Christofides.\nMr Collins says that as black soldier fly larvae have only been farmed commercially over the past decade and a half, there is still much to learn, and that the use of AI can rapidly speed up this process.\n\"Rice farmers are still trying to create the perfect crop after 13,500 years of passed down generational learning,\" he says. \"Black soldier fly larvae have been farmed for 0.1% of the time rice has been grown, and that's reflected in our current understanding.\"\nMr Collins adds that the firm's strategy will be to use AI to glean insights \"no human could ever achieve\", by using multiple sensors and crunching millions of data points.\nYet he adds that sometimes you just need to leave the flies to get on with things on their own. Such as the breeding process, whereby mature flies mate on green ribbons laid out in such a way as to account for their territorial tendencies.\n\"You need to consider their social and behavioural dynamics as animals,\" says Mr Collins.",

        "content": "The US has accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a \"method of warfare\" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use.\nState department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win \"battlefield gains\" over Ukraine. \nThe allegations, which US officials said were not an \"isolated\" incident, would contravene the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Russia signed.\nThe Kremlin has yet to comment, but has denied similar allegations in the past.\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.\nIn 2017, the OPCW said Russia had destroyed the last of its Cold War-era stockpile of the weapons. \nBut Moscow has since been accused of making incomplete declarations of its stockpile, according to the UK's House of Commons library.\nSince 2017, Russia has been accused of at least two chemical attacks - the Salisbury attack on a former Soviet intelligence officer and the 2020 poisoning of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \nChloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to \"dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions\" - is an oily substance which was widely used during WW1. It causes irritation of the eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). \nThe chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW. \nThe state department also said Moscow has regularly used \"riot control agents,\" or tear gas, during the war. \nPresident Joe Biden has previously warned Russia against deploying chemical weapons in Ukraine. In March 2022, just weeks after Moscow launched its invasion, Mr Biden vowed that Russia would pay a \"severe price\" if it did use chemical weapons. \n\"We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,\" the president said.\nBut there have been consistent reports that Moscow has ignored that warning. US Assistant Secretary for Arms Control Mallory Stewart has previously said Russia was using riot control agents in the conflict.\nAnd Ukraine says its troops have faced mounting chemical attacks in recent months. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this year that Russian forces have used grenades loaded with CS and CN tear gasses. \nThe report added that at least 500 Ukrainian soldiers have been treated for exposure to toxic gasses, and that one had died after suffocating on tear gas. \nState department officials said they were sanctioning three Russian-state bodies linked to the country's biological and chemical weapons programme, and four firms which contributed to the government entities. \nRussia has repeatedly denied deploying chemical weapons in the conflict. \n\"There are no chemical weapons in the stockpiles of the Russian army, as confirmed by international investigations,\" its embassy in the Netherlands said in January. \nThe allegations come as part of a broader tranche of US sanctions which targeted 30 individuals, including three people officials say were involved in the death of Mr Navalny. \nThe men are all officials at the Siberian prison colony where the opposition activist was killed earlier this year. Russia denies involvement in the opposition leader's death. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have continued their steady advance ahead of the country's Victory Day celebrations on 9 May - the holiday commemorating the Soviet victory in World War Two. \nMuch of the fighting has been taking place around Chasiv Yar, a Kyiv-controlled stronghold which Russia has been trying to reach after seizing the city of Avdiivka.\nIt comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's Security Service's (SBU) cyber-security department, Illya Vityuk, amid allegations that he tried to use his position to punish a Ukrainian journalist who had reported on allegations of corruption against him. \nThe reporter was subsequently summoned to a military recruitment centre, prompting military chief Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi to launch an investigation. \nElsewhere, Human Rights Watch - a non-governmental organisation - has called for a war crimes investigation after it unearthed evidence that Russian forces executed over a dozen surrendering Ukrainian troops. The events allegedly occurred between December 2023 and February 2024, the body said in a statement. ",

But the OECD said this \"only partially offsets the ongoing fiscal drag from frozen personal income tax thresholds\".Fiscal drag means that as a person's salary rises, they can move into a higher income tax bracket.The organisation also said that a government scheme to allow businesses to deduct the full cost of investing in machinery and equipment from their tax bill does \"less than fully compensate\" for an increase in corporation tax which rose from 19% to 25% this time last year.

        "content": "Riot police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon into crowds protesting against a bill seen by the opposition as targeting media freedoms.\nThousands waving Georgian and European Union flags gathered outside parliament for a second night to protest what they see as a Russian-inspired law.\nMPs approved the second reading of the controversial \"foreign agent\" bill on Wednesday.\nThe EU warns it could harm Tbilisi's ambitions of joining the bloc.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday she was following events in Georgia with \"great concern\".  \"The Georgian people want a European future for their country. Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\" she posted on X.\nProtesters fear that the proposed foreign influence bill could be used to crush critical voices ahead of parliamentary elections later this year.\nOpponents say the measures are inspired by authoritarian legislation that neighbouring Russia uses to crush dissent. The billionaire founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, claimed this week that a Western \"global war\" party was using the country as part of its confrontation with Russia.\nA similar authoritarian law that came into force in Russia in 2012 has since been used to marginalise voices challenging the Kremlin - including prominent cultural figures, media organisations and civil society groups.\nThe bill cleared its second reading with a vote of 83 to 23. After a third reading it has to be signed off by President Salome Zurabishvili, who has vowed to veto the bill, although Georgian Dream has sufficient numbers in parliament to overrule her.\nThe governing party wants the law enacted by the end of the month. Once that happens, organisations would be required to state whether they are funded from abroad.\nGeorgia has been rocked by weeks of protests over the issue. On Tuesday night, there were similar clashes between police and protesters on Rustaveli Avenue, outside parliament.\nSeveral people were injured, including Levan Khabeishvili, chairman of the main opposition party United National Movement (UNM). He posted a picture of his bruised face on social media and later appeared in parliament, his face heavily bandaged.\nEyewitnesses accused some police officers of physically attacking protesters and EU foreign police chief Josep Borrell said he strongly condemned violence against Georgians \"who were peacefully demonstrating against the law on foreign influence\".\nDeputy interior minister Aleksandre Darakhvelidze said six officers were hurt and 63 people arrested and he complained that \"the rally turned completely violent\". He said Mr Khabeishvili had been hurt while trying to break through a police cordon, although his party said he had been beaten by police.\nGeorgia was granted EU candidate status last December and polls suggest about 80% of the population is in favour of joining. \nProtests against the bill began in mid-April, with many Georgians fearing the government's measures would derail Georgia from its path towards membership, says the BBC's South Caucasus correspondent, Rayhan Demytrie.\nUnder the proposals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and independent media would be required to register as organisations \"bearing the interests of a foreign power\", if they receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors.\nThey would also be monitored by Georgia's justice ministry and could be forced to share sensitive information - or face hefty fines of up to 25,000 Georgian lari ($9,400; £7,500).\nA number of European leaders have warned the proposed bill is \"incompatible\" with European norms and values.\nBut the government of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze is standing firm. \nMr Kobakhidze has accused NGOs of attempting to stage revolutions in Georgia twice, of promoting \"gay propaganda\" and of attacking the Georgian Orthodox Church. \nThe government insists the bill is about ensuring transparency and rejects the notion that it is against European values - or that Russia is behind the legislation. \nOn Monday, Bidzina Ivanishvili told a rally of Georgian Dream supporters that foreign-funded NGOs threatened Georgian sovereignty and that the opposition UNM would be punished for crimes against the state after this year's elections.\nPresident Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, described the pro-government rally as a \"Putin-type\" event.\nMs Zourabichvili, who is strongly opposed to the foreign influence bill, has appealed to the interior ministry to stop using \"disproportionate force\" against protesters.",

        "content": "Kendrick Lamar has released a diss track attacking fellow rap star Drake, escalating their long-running feud.\nCalled Euphoria, the song is a response to weeks of taunting by Drake, who has taken pot-shots at Lamar on a series of viral diss tracks.\nOver six minutes, Lamar calls Drake a \"manipulator and habitual liar\", and criticises his parenting skills.\nHe also accuses the Canadian star of selling out, saying he only makes music to \"pacify\" fans.\nAnd he leaves listeners under no illusions about the strength of his feelings towards Drake. \n\"This ain't been 'bout critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest,\" he raps. \"It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater.\"\"This ain't been 'bout critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest,\" he raps. \"It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater.\"\n\"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"\"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\nThe rappers' feud dates back to 2013, when Lamar was a relative newcomer. \nDuring a performance at the BET Awards, he boasted that his skills had \"tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pyjama clothes\". The line was interpreted as a reference to Drake, whose soul-baring blend of rap and R&B had changed the sound of hip-hop.\nThe feud simmered for a few years, boiling over again last year, when J Cole and Drake described themselves, along with Lamar, as the \"big three\" of rap, on the song First Person Shooter.\nThe seemingly innocuous comment went unremarked for months. Then, in the middle of March, Lamar delivered a fiery verse on Like That, declaring that there was no \"big three - it's just big me\".\nIn April, Drake released the first of two diss tracks, titled Push Ups, in which he mocked Lamar's height as well as his collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\nLater that month, Drake dropped another song, Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he taunted Lamar, calling him a coward for failing to respond. \nThe track controversially used AI technology to imitate the voices of Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur - one of Lamar's heroes. \nAfter a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.After a complaint from Shakur's estate, Drake pulled the song off his Instagram.\nLamar's Euphoria similarly criticises the use of AI, saying it would \"make [Tu]pac turn in his grave\". \nHe also asks \"Am I battlin' ghost or AI?\" - a reference to the accusation that Drake has used ghostwriters in the past.\nLamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"Lamar even addresses the time it took to record a response, with the combative lyric: \"Y'all think all of my life is rap? I got a son to raise, but I can see you know nothin' 'bout that.\"\nA former Pulitzer Prize winner for his fourth album, Damn, Lamar uses the song to display the dexterity of his voice, switching between flows and rhythmic meters throughout. \nHe even appears to be mimicking Drake's Toronto accent in the closing bars.\nHowever, fans who were hoping for a slam-dunk conclusion to the rap beef were disappointed.\nLamar conceded: \"I like Drake with with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough,\" and declined to respond to Drake naming his wife on a previous song. \n\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\"We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way,\" he rapped.\nThe rift has drawn in several other rappers over the last few months, with stars such as Kanye West, The Weeknd and Rick Ross releasing songs that reference the fall-out.\nDrake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.Drake responded to Lamar's latest volley on Instagram, sharing a scene from the 1990s romcom 10 Things I Hate About You, where Julia Stiles' character recites a poem listing her grievances against Heath Ledger's \"bad boy\" character.\nIt's presumably intended as a parody of Lamar's lyrics - but Drake seems to have forgotten how the scene ends.\n\"I hate the way I don't hate you,\" says Stiles, choking back tears. \"Not even close, not even a little bit.\"",

        "content": "A Commonwealth Games medallist has withdrawn from a world championship tournament due to a lack of funding.\nCraig Bowler, from Buckinghamshire, represented England in para bowling at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nHe said playing at the International Bowls for the Disabled (IBD) World Championships would cost him about £3,000.\nDisability Bowls England (DBE) said funding a team at next month's tournament would \"bankrupt\" it.\nMr Bowler, 45, from Olney, near Milton Keynes, was selected to play at the competition in South Africa between 18 and 31 May.\nHe said he was \"gutted\" he could not go but he refused to pay when he could use the money for his family instead.\n\"I am a good bowler, and it is frustrating because I know I could do well. We should be taking the best out there, not just people who can afford it,\" he said.\n\"DBE is a charity and they can't afford it. For some people, bowls is all they have, and without DBE that support would not be there.\"\nMr Bowler lost both his legs and an arm when he tried to take his own life.\nWhen he woke up from a coma, he said he was \"just happy I didn't die\".\nHe later married his physiotherapist's assistant, who he now has two children with.\n\"After my accident I was told it would take three and a half years to walk again. I did it in six weeks,\" he said.\n\"I was determined. I knew it would be difficult but I had a second chance at life, so I turned every negative into a positive.\"\nA friend's father invited him to a bowls club and after two hours he was hooked, despite initially thinking it was an \"old man's game\".\nEight years later, Mr Bowler won a bronze at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. \nSteve Watson, DBE chairperson, said the charity received no funding from the government or the sports governing body.\n\"All our funding to help change the lives of people with a disability comes from personal donations, charity foundation grants and the support of family, friends and fellow bowlers,\" he said.\n\"Every penny raised has been used to change the lives of many with a disability and enabled them to play bowls over the past 40 years.\"\nHe added that DBE had made the \"very difficult decision\" to continue to run a programme for the 2023/24 indoor season and the outdoor season until the end of September 2024.\nThat meant it could not fund the DBE team going to the world championships \"as this would have made us bankrupt\".\nA team of 16 and their managers have self-funded the trip, which was later reduced to £2,500 per person following a reduction in flight costs.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

He added that during the winter months there would not be anything else for elderly people to do, and questioned why there was not more consideration for the players. \nNoreen Fleet, 81, has been attending the club with her husband Bob, 85, for more than a decade.She said she would miss the indoor rink, and does not know what else she will be able to do instead. \nThe changes to the town's activity centre are part of the town deal which includes over £20m from the government's Towns Fund, along with another £18.4m from match funders.Bob Metcalfe, from the town deal board, said the new centre would provide sports, alongside health and wellbeing services.Mr Metcalfe added he appreciated this was a change to the purpose-built bowls rink, but a compromise was found to provide a wider range of activities.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

It wasn't perfectly right to take a break from the bad atmosphere and go and have fun.\n\"But at the same time, I wanted to come here and show myself as Israeli on television and in person to show us also in a positive side, not only in the war that is going on and the two sides that are hurting.\n\"Getting to spend a week with my brother and try to crack a win against top bowlers in the world, it's been pure fun.\"\nThroughout the World Championships, seeded players Wayne Willgress and Mervyn King are among those who have said how difficult it is to judge the pace of the portable blue rink, and they live just down the road.\nSo imagine the difficulty level for David and Zvika, given there are no indoor bowls venues in Israel. They are both members of Ra'Annana Bowls Club.\n\"Bowls in Israel is not as popular as it is here,\" Zvika says. \"There's four clubs, with 400-500 members, playing on grass.\n\"We don't have indoor or artificial outdoors so we have to make a big adjustment when we come here.\"\nFortunately, there were a couple of former World Champions on hand to give some help to David, who has only been playing a few years.\n\"As a first time international bowler, I practised with two legends, Greg Harlow and David Gourlay MBE,\" he said. \n\"They both were very nice, they helped me, they gave me tips.

        "published_date": "2024-04-25",

        "description": "There's been carnage and plunder in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket tournament, this year.  ",
        "content": "There's been carnage and plunder in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's richest cricket tournament, this year.  \nAt grounds across the country, batters are throwing caution to the winds, unleashing big shots without mercy and turning virtually every match into a six-hitting festival. This is leaving bowlers hapless, confounding experts and fans about where Twenty20 cricket is headed.\nLook at some of the numbers highlighting the batting mayhem witnessed so far. \nAfter the 39th match of the season between Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday night, a total of 1,191 fours and 686 sixes had been struck. \nIn comparison, IPL 2023 recorded 2,174 fours and 1,124 sixes. Even with less than half the current season remaining, it's reasonable to expect last year's figures to be easily exceeded.\nThe increase in fours and sixes has correspondingly boosted team totals.\nIn the early IPL seasons, a score of 150-160 was deemed competitive, but today it often leads to defeat in eight out of 10 games. To illustrate the shift in scoring patterns, consider Yuvraj Singh's six sixes off Stuart Broad in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, where India totalled 218 - a monumental achievement at the time. However, 16 years later, team scores of 200 have become routine. \nIn the 39 matches of this IPL season up to Tuesday, teams have surpassed the 200-run mark 19 times. Aggregate scores have exceeded 400 runs nine times, with two matches astonishingly surpassing 500 runs!\nThere's more. \nThe average run rate this season hovers around 10 per over. \nUnfancied Sunrisers Hyderabad, who have been in record-breaking overdrive since the start of the season, clobbered an unprecedented 125 runs in the first powerplay (six overs) against Delhi Capitals which translates into a mind-boggling 20.83 runs per over. \nThe Sunrisers have scored more than 250 runs in an innings thrice this season, with a whopping 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL record suggesting that the 300-run landmark is in danger of being overhauled, perhaps this season itself.\nT20 cricket, by nature, guarantees high-octane action. Batting demands relentless stroke play, where even a dot ball is unacceptable. Batters are tasked with maximising run value per delivery, granting them unrestricted freedom to hit. Despite the risks that this strategy brings, the run-scoring, fuelled by boundaries and sixes, has been exceptional this season.\nWhat's influencing such explosive batting? \nFlat pitches for one. \nAs a thumb rule, pitches for white-ball cricket, ODIs and T20, are curated to be benign, rather than \"sporting\" the world over. Because T20 holds out the promise of spectacular action, big shots have become a staple of the format - for fans, broadcasters and sponsors - and everything is done to facilitate this. Unlike in other T20 leagues, the IPL takes this seriously enough to ensure that pitches remain strongly batting friendly.\nHowever flat tracks are not the only hurdle bowlers face. \nBatters have become fitter, stronger, and more importantly, adventurous, particularly young players weaned on T20 in their formative years. They take more risks, attempt more spectacular feats to win matches, to stave off competition or for greater recognition and reward. \nSome rule changes have also contributed in diminishing the role of bowlers. \nFor instance, the introduction of the Impact Substitute this IPL season has afforded coaches and captains the option of bringing in a player at an opportune time. It's an interesting improvisation, and even a bowler can be brought in as an Impact Sub. But the trend so far favours players who extend batting depth and heft.\nAn old cliché goes that cricket is a batter's game. But whether this growing imbalance between bat and ball is good for even T20 is the hot debate on the cricket circuit currently. \nInterestingly, former India captain and batting great Sunil Gavaskar puts his weight behind bowlers in this scenario. \"If it gets so-one-sided, it takes away from the contest, reduces interest,\" he says. \nGavaskar's big peeve is about the boundary distance being reduced from the conventional 75 yards to 65 or even lesser. \n\"A bowler forces a mistake from the batsman but is penalised because the boundary has been brought in. What could have been a catch results in six runs!\" he fumes. \nGiven the proficiency of modern bats, even mishits can travel considerable distances, justifying Gavaskar's concern.\nEqually intriguingly, former South African pace bowling great Dale Steyn sees the situation as one which challenges the skills and temperament of bowlers. \"There's opportunity and incentive for bowlers to become heroes in four overs,\" says Steyn.\nT20 skill sets and mindsets have shifted dramatically from the orthodox and continue to evolve. This demands players across all departments to be dynamic, proactive, and creative.\nBut the balance between bat and ball has to tend towards equal if T20 is not to become a fusion of golf and baseball masquerading as cricket.",

And so if we're able to buy one shoe, there's a real benefit there. \n\"Sometimes you have one shoe that wears out much faster than the other. \n\"It could mean that people could be less wasteful by getting that one shoe replacement.\"\nJosephine had her amputation in 2018, and agrees \"more representation\" is a good thing.\nBut when it's not followed up with actions, \"it can it can kind of cut a bit in the gut,\" she says.\nStef feels it's not a case of companies being \"intentionally non-inclusive\", but more a case of \"nobody's asked the question\".\n\"Often I think it's an oversight,\" she says.\n\"I don't have an expectation that every company is going to cater to me as an amputee, at a financial loss to them.\n\"But diverse and inclusive thinking can lead to a better way of doing business.\"\nIn a TikTok video, Stef, who won T44 bronze in 2008 when previously representing Canada, also spoke about other companies - Decathlon and Brooks Running - having similar policies.\nBrooks told Newsbeat it's \"a brand that believes in the power of a diverse running community\" and was \"looking into solutions to fill\" requests for single shoes.\nDecathlon has not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Aged 16, he was paralysed from the base of his ribs down.\n\"I felt I had lost a huge part of myself,\" he says.\n\"I was also in my first year of A-levels so I had that to juggle and had missed a year of school, but I passed and that was when I started to concentrate on myself, not my studies.\"\nThrough a friend, he tried a racing simulator but switched to an adapted racing car - reaching speeds of 150mph (241km/h) - just three months after passing his driving test.\nHe now competes in a BMW M240i alongside team mate Asha Silva, from Kettering.\n\"It is a completely different way of driving and it's something I need to get used to, but I never learned to drive a car using my legs,\" he says.\n\"I think motorsport is the only sport where I can be on a completely level playing field, and we are proving that.\n\"There's nothing stopping us being the fastest out there.\n\"It doesn't matter who you are, as long as you can drive a car.\n\"It's given me the majority of my confidence that I've gained since the accident; it's made me feel like myself before the accident.\n\"My dream is to push the boundaries even further - GT3 is where I would like to be at.\n\"It's completely achievable, I just need time behind the wheel.\"\nAsha Silva started out as a rookie after realising her race driver potential on a computer simulation. \nLike Noah, she had long wanted to compete in the real fast lane - but took a little longer to get there.\nAfter struggles with her mental health, she was encouraged by her wife to seek help and was eventually diagnosed with ADHD and adult autism.\nShe says the conditions give her a \"hyperfocus\", which is an asset behind the wheel.\n\"I use pedals and on the side of the steering wheel we have rocker switches - gear up, gear down - and I function that way.\n\"My business-as-usual is to have 110 things going through my mind but as soon as I am behind that steering wheel I have one thing on my mind.\n\"All that noise goes away and I can put all my attention on the command coming through radio and put that straight into output on track.\n\"It's about passion; when we have passion for something we tend to focus solely on that.\n\"I want to say its a superpower but it's just how my brain works.\"\nShe says Team BRIT is a special place and \"just one big family\".\n\"Inclusion is top of the agenda,\" she adds. \n\"We all come from different walks of life and we all understand each other's journeys and we give each other the time and space.\n\"When I grew up people asked me what I wanted to do when I was older, my actual answer was 'I want to be a race driver or a pilot'.\n\"Here I am at 40 years old and I'm able to do it; it means everything to me.\n\"It's a dream come true.\"\nPaul Fullick, 40, from Southampton, was a member of the British Army until a diving accident forced him into early retirement.\nHe was still very active and competed in driving and riding challenges for charity, including getting to Gambia in a car that cost him £100.\nThen, in 2021, he lost his right leg after a motorcycle accident while touring in Wales. \n\"Team BRIT means everything to me; it was part therapy, part adventure,\" he says.\n\"I used to be a motorcycle racer but couldn't do that anymore after my amputation.\n\"I found Team Brits, emailed them from hospital and three weeks later they had me in a car and I was out racing. \n\"It gave me something to focus on; rehabilitation is 100% about focus and having something to really concentrate on gave me everything I needed.\"\nHe said being able to race every weekend in the McLaren 570s GT4 meant his rehabilitation was never boring and, importantly, he could compete as before.\n\"Once you are in the car the other drivers don't see a disability,\" he adds.\n\"To be able to go out there with an anonymity and just compete as a person, not a disabled person, is really, really important.\n\"I can't think of another sport where you can compete on that level playing field.\n\"The goal is be the first disabled team to compete at Le Mans - I would love to be part of it when we make that history.\"\"The goal is be the first disabled team to compete at Le Mans - I would love to be part of it when we make that history.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Every company Salim and Shaun approached with the idea told them it was impossible.\n\"When I first started looking into the diving, I contacted a number of different companies,\" Shaun said.\n\"As soon as you mention disabilities, as soon as you mention paralysis there was a lot of barriers put up.\"\nSalim said: \"[They were] silly excuses not to be able to do it, and I think it's because of lack of awareness.\n\"But we're both the type of people that will not accept no as an answer.\"\nThe pair want to set a new world record for the first time a blind person and a paraplegic amputee have dived together.\nWhen Curly, an Egyptian diving instructor at Morecambe Area Divers heard their plan, he agreed to train the pair to complete their challenge.\n\"We want to spread the word that diving is for every body, for every ability,\" Shaun said.\n\"Because we are all equal underwater.\"\nSalim said: \"We can show people, there's nothing to actually stop you [doing something].\n\"Apart from what's in your head.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram?

        "content": "The US justice department will pay $138.7m (£110m) to survivors of disgraced national gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.\nIn a 2022 lawsuit, some of Nassar's victims alleged that the FBI mishandled credible complaints of sexual assaults and failed to take them seriously.\nThe 139 claimants included US Olympic gymnastics gold medallists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney. \nNassar is currently serving up to 175 years in prison for sexual assault.\nIn 2021, the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General, which serves as a watchdog for the FBI, concluded that the agency disregarded allegations about Nassar and made a raft of errors. \nThe FBI investigation into Nassar began in 2015, but the inspector found mistakes in the inquiry, including a failure to formally document meeting with USA Gymnastics officials after they concluded their own five-week internal probe into Nassar's behaviour. It also cited a failure to contact state and local authorities about the potential risk he continued to pose to athletes. \nNassar continued to see patients for over a year after allegations against him were first made to the FBI. \nMost of the claimants in the lawsuit said they were assaulted after Nassar's abuse was first reported in 2015. The majority were athletes with the USA Gymnastics programme or with Michigan State University, where Nassar maintained a clinic.\n\"For decades, Lawrence Nassar abused his position, betraying the trust of those under his care and medical supervision while skirting accountability,\" said Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C Mizer in a statement announcing the settlement - among the largest in DOJ history - on Tuesday. \n\"These allegations should have been taken seriously from the outset,\" Mr Mizer said. \"While these settlements won't undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing.\"\nIn a 2022 statement, Ms Maroney said that Nassar's victims were \"betrayed by every institution that was supposed to protect us - the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, the FBI and the Department of Justice.\" \n\"It is clear that the only path to justice and healing is through the legal process,\" she added. \nIn total, legal pay-outs stemming from Nassar's actions and their aftermath have totalled more than $1bn. \nThose payments included a $500m settlement between Michigan State and hundreds of survivors in 2018, as well as a $380m settlement with athletes from USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee. \nIn 2021, FBI Director Christopher Wray apologised to the athletes. The FBI also fired one of their agents involved in the investigation.\nIn total, more than 330 women accused Nassar of sexual abuse. He is serving up to 175 years for various sexual assault convictions, and others relating to images of child sex abuse.\nNassar was stabbed by another inmate at a Florida prison last year, narrowly escaping with his life only after correctional officers provided medical assistance.

        "content": "A group of ice hockey fans were left stranded in Northern Ireland at the weekend after flights were cancelled because of Storm Kathleen.\nEleven Sheffield Steelers supporters flew to watch their team play two games against Belfast Giants.\nBut their attempts to get home on Sunday were thwarted when strong winds caused the cancellation of two flights.\nThey arrived home safely on Monday - although one of the group admitted the trip had been a \"headache\".\nDean Quartermaine said the group had been \"left to their own devices\" at Belfast City Airport after the cancellations, before eventually transferring to Dublin Airport to catch alternative flights home.\nStorm Kathleen brought strong winds to the UK over the weekend, with events cancelled, trees down and power outages.\nThousands of people were delayed by the storm with flights, rail services and ferries affected.\nMr Quartermaine, a tutor at Sheffield College, said his group had to spend around £150 each extra on food, drink and accommodation.\nThey also had to cover the cost of travelling to Dublin.\nHe said with no Aer Lingus staff at Belfast City Airport, he felt the airline had not \"covered themselves in glory\".\nAer Lingus told the BBC the Steelers fans' flights were cancelled because of \"disruption in our schedule\".\nMeanwhile, a coach tour from South Yorkshire was stranded on the Isle of Man after the ferry home was cancelled because of the storm.\nDave Mills, of Yorkshire Rose tours in Barnsley, said his passengers arrived home at around 02:30 BST on Tuesday after paying for two extra nights in a hotel.\n\"People enjoyed the first night but by the second they were ready for home,\" he said, adding that most were \"tired but in good spirits\" by the end of the journey.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

        "content": "Sport events across the country have struggled to attract as many fans back after the Covid pandemic - but one professional team is bucking the trend.South-west Scotland may not be seen as a sporting heartland, but it's proving to be a thriving base for the Solway Sharks. Attendances at its National Ice Hockey League fixtures have risen sharply by more than double this season. The Dumfries Ice Bowl is now packed out every weekend - but why have fans been bitten by the Solway Sharks?\nBetween 700 to 800 fans are making \"the Shark Tank\" the liveliest place in the regional capital during most Saturday evenings. Maureen Cochrane got the bug after meeting her husband Dave, and they have followed the Sharks around the country. She said: \"I didn't know anything about the Sharks until I met Dave eight years ago. \"I'd never been to an ice hockey match before. He asked me if I wanted to go, and I thought 'no, why would I want to do that?'.\"But I came, and as soon as I was here I said 'right when's the next one'.\"I don't know how but it just kind of grabs you, and it feels like a family here.\"\nThe Sharks are battling for the play-offs in their first ever season in the national league, after being promoted from Division 1 North.Entrepreneur John Strange is a pivotal figure behind the \"mini-revolution\", having bought into the outfit last summer. He was involved with Glasgow Clan, but a half-hour conversation \"changed everything\" and he quickly \"fell in love\" with the Sharks.The co-owner said: \"Ice hockey is the fastest indoor sport in the world, one of the most competitive sports in the world.\"The atmosphere we create in the rink, the players we've got, and the sheer magic of a game of ice hockey is why people have been bitten by the Sharks.\"\nWhile Dumfries and Galloway's three professional football teams - Queen of the South, Annan Athletic and Stranraer - are all struggling, the Sharks are enjoying their best ever season.The side beat the Berkshire-based Bees 5-2 in front of hundreds of beach-shirt clad fans on Saturday, with beating drums in the stands and music booming.Lynn Ross has been a regular at the Ice Bowl for the last five years with her husband Andrew and their 14-year-old daughter Skye.The 47-year-old feels the \"good atmosphere\" pulls people in.\nMrs Ross said: \"We first came down as one of the players used to work for us.\"We've brought friends and family, and all just got the bug. There's good advertisement, but people also come through word of mouth after hearing how good it is.\"It's local to us, and it's been nice for us to have supported them from being a little team.\"The guys have worked their way up the leagues really well, and they're holding their own.\"\nStevie-Jo Black, a teenager from Dumfries, has been attending Solway Sharks matches with her friends for several years after a player visited the local community centre.She said: \"From there I just grew more into the hockey.\"Now we try and come every week and I just love it. The fights, the fans, the atmosphere and it's something to do on a Saturday.\"Ms Black's friend Chloe Nelson added that \"the joy, the happiness and the atmosphere\" is what led to her donning a Sharks jersey in the stands. Having watched the Sharks for about 10 years, she said: \"It's been amazing how it's changed over the seasons, my wee brother now plays junior hockey as well.\"\"We're seeing more people come to watch from outside Dumfries, people from Stranraer and Annan, and they love it just as much as we do.\"\nThe Solway Sharks owners said they had a lot to consider with their heavy schedule, playing both 56 matches, with both home and away fixtures, across 28 weekends. Mr Strange said the aim was to attract 1,000 fans to the ice bowl every weekend, but they don't want to achieve that \"in competition\" with their neighbours - Queen of the South.James Thorburn is a season ticket holder at Palmerston Park, but left early during the recent 4-1 defeat to Falkirk to watch the ice hockey. The 67-year-old said: \"It's just a wonderful experience, everyone is so friendly, the game is hugely exciting, even if the Sharks lose.\"You're guaranteed an enjoyable evening.\"\nFollow the BBC for the South of Scotland on X.

The move is part of Inverness Ice Centre's efforts to stay in business.Like many of Scotland's rinks, Inverness has seen its energy bill rocket.Last year, the cost of running its refrigeration plant increased from £12,000 to as much as £25,000 a month.Last year, the cost of running its refrigeration plant increased from £12,000 to as much as £25,000 a month.\nOther Scottish rinks have been experiencing similar difficulties, and there are concerns about the future of the rink in Perth where Olympic curler Eve Muirhead began her career.Other Scottish rinks have been experiencing similar difficulties, and there are concerns about the future of the rink in Perth where Olympic curler Eve Muirhead began her career.Last year, Inverness Ice Centre went ice-free after the end of the curling season in April, through to July to cut costs. To keep money coming in, the space was used for hosting boxing events, a gig by Scottish singer Callum Beattie and gin and whisky festivals.Among this year's initiatives will be an unofficial Euros 24 fans zone with food stalls and big screens showing games from Scotland's appearance at the European football championships in Germany.\nIce hockey player and coach Jamie Brown was involved in the centre's decision to go ice-free.He said the move helped to ensure the centre could keep going and continue to offer competitive and recreational youth and adult skating, curling and ice hockey the rest of the year.\"When it comes down to pounds and pence we just cannot afford to keep the rink open,\" he said.\"The rising energy costs are an absolute killer - the cost of keeping the ice frozen is absolutely massive.\"Once the curling season is over, the usage by ice sports is a lot less through the week.\"Last year, we melted the ice down to keep that side of things down to zero.\"\nMr Brown said this did have an impact on activities such as ice hockey, and there was a risk young people might lose interest over the summer closure.He said Inverness Highlanders Junior Ice Hockey Club was exploring the potential of hiring a hall and playing on roller skates as one way of keeping teams together until the rink was frozen again.\nThe club is involved in other ventures to help it, along with other clubs in north and north-east Scotland, to keep going.One key area it has been tackling is a decline in participation caused by the Covid pandemic's disruptive effect on sport.At the moment it has 15 new starts in addition to its 24 registered players, but used to have more. Inverness has teamed up with a junior ice hockey club in Elgin to have enough players to form an under-12s team -  Moray Highlanders - to compete in a national league.The Inverness and Elgin clubs are also working with one in Aviemore so they can offer competitive matches for 12 to 18-year-old players.They play in a mini tournament called the Northern Cup.The Inverness' young ice hockey players include 11-year-olds Laurie Dent, Bode MacDonald, Jonah Nelson and Rebecca Nixon, 13. They said they enjoyed the sport because it was played at speed, and was a sport they could play with their friends.\nKaty Kitchingham, chairwoman of Inverness Highlanders Junior Ice Hockey Club, said it was hoped the collaborative work would lead to increased participation. She said: \"It was our club's 30-year anniversary last year, so there's been ice hockey in Inverness for a wee while now and we want to see that continue.\"\nIn Aviemore there is a small rink housed in a large marquee. More than 30 young people, aged from six to 18, take part in its junior sessions.But Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust, which runs the rink, hopes to buck the trend of ice rink closures and build a new permanent ice rink in the village.The last facility was bulldozed in 1999.Kenny Macdonald, who has played ice hockey for 50 years and coaches juniors in Aviemore, said: \"Our main thing we are looking for is a bigger ice surface.\"He believes the rink will be a popular addition to Aviemore's attractions, including during the local ski season.\"You cannot rely on the snow now in winter theses days and if you have got a bad day when it is raining and too wet to go cycling, a large ice rink would be ideal and I'm sure you would see the influx seen in the 1980s and 90s,\" he added.

        "content": "Canadian police have apologised for the length of time it took to press charges against five ice hockey players accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2018. \nPolice in London, Ontario laid charges last week against four National Hockey League (NHL) players and one former player.\nA review of the case found evidence that was \"not available\" in an initial investigation, police said on Monday.\nAll five have denied wrongdoing and say they will plead not guilty.\nThe five were members of Canada's World Junior hockey team when the alleged assault took place.\nAt a press conference on Monday, police chief Thai Troung said: \"My sincerest apology to the victim and to the family for the amount of time that it has taken to reach this point.\" \n\"I truly am not happy about this,\" he said. \nPolice closed an initial investigation into the alleged assault in 2019 and no charges were laid, but the file was reopened three years later when the case came under public scrutiny in Canada.  \nSgt Katherine Dann, who leading the case review, said her department found that there were \"additional steps that could have been taken to advance the investigation\". \nOn Monday, the lawyers for the players made the first appearance on behalf of their clients in a London court. None of the players appeared.\nProsecutors also requested a publication ban on the identity of the victim and two witnesses in the case.\nAll five players are facing one count of sexual assault. Player Mike McLeod is also being charged with being party to the offence.\nThe four players in the NHL are Mr McLeod and Cal Foote with the New Jersey Devils, the Philadelphia Flyers' Carter Hart, and the Calgary Flames' Dillon Dubé.\nThe fifth is ex-NHL player Alex Formenton. Up until his arrest, Mr Formenton played for Swiss hockey club Ambri-Piotta.\nThey have been on leave from their teams pending the outcome of the case. \nAsked whether charges could be laid against more players, Sgt Dann said: \"We have laid changes for all the parties that we have reasonable grounds for.\" \nIn 2022, the woman at the centre of the case filed a lawsuit against Hockey Canada - which manages programmes and teams in the country from entry-level all the way to world championships and the Olympic Games - alleging that she had been assaulted by eight players in a hotel room in July 2018.\nThat May, sports network TSN revealed Hockey Canada had quietly reached a settlement with the woman.\nThe revelation was met with national outcry in Canada, resulting in the organisation losing federal funding and several high-profile sponsorship deals.\nWhen asked why it took nearly six years for police to press charges and whether the force failed in its initial investigation, Mr Troung declined to elaborate, saying it could compromise the investigation. \n\"Why it took so long will form part of the proceedings,\" he said. \nThe NHL also launched its own investigation, which has since concluded, but Commissioner Gary Bettman has said its conclusions will not be made public as the matter is now before the courts.\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday during the NHL All-Star weekend in Toronto, Mr Bettman added that the NHL players, who are all free agents as of the end of the current season, will no longer be with their teams as the trial commences.\n\"At this stage the most responsible and prudent thing to do is await the conclusion of the judicial proceedings,\" Mr Bettman said. \nHe also called the allegations \"abhorrent\" and defended the sport in light of the charges.\n\"This is not representative of what takes place in our game,\" Mr Bettman said. \"We want people to know that our game is inclusive, welcoming and safe.\" \nThe players' next court appearance is scheduled for April 30. Under Canadian law, a sexual assault conviction carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. ",

He was my hero.\"\nSherry was granted bail as he was told he will be sentenced on 1 May.\nAdjourning the case for a pre-sentence report, Judge David Swinnerton told him: \"I have heard quite a lot about your karate career but I need to get more background information about you.\" \nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

        "content": "University of Oxford rowers have criticised sewage levels in the Thames after losing the Boat Race to Cambridge.\nHigh levels of E. coli have been found in the river where universities race every year. \nLeonard Jenkins of the Oxford men's team told BBC Sport he had been vomiting before the race. Leonard Jenkins of the Oxford men's team told BBC Sport he had been vomiting before the race. \nThames Water has said improving river health was a \"key focus\" for the company.\nOn Wednesday, Environment Agency figures revealed raw sewage spills doubled last year in England to 3.6 million hours of spills compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022.\nWithin the spills are human waste, wet wipes and sanitary products which can pose a serious risk to swimmers. \nBoat race crews had been given safety advice to avoid swallowing water splashed up from the Thames. \nCambridge, who won both male and female races, was also warned against throwing the cox into the water as is tradition. \nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Mr Jenkins said: \"This morning I was throwing up and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to race.\n\"It would be a lot nicer if there wasn't as much poo in the water.\n\"It's not to take away from Cambridge, as we may not have beaten them even if we were all on top form.\"\nA second member of squad said three people had to miss training sessions due to stomach bugs.\nIn a statement, Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC) said: \"Three members of the OUBC men's blue boat came down with a stomach bug in the week of The Boat Race, the origin of which we cannot definitively say.\"\n\"These things happen in the final lead up to the race, including in years we have won,\" it continued.\nCoxswain Will Denegri said: \"Whether that's related to E. coli in the river I don't know, but it's certainly not helped our campaign...\n\"It's not an excuse, but it definitely hasn't helped our preparation.\"\nTesting by campaign body River Action and Fulham Reach Boat Club earlier this month detected high levels of E. coli, which can cause serious infections. \nRiver Action said the testing locations in its research suggested the source of pollution was from Thames Water discharging sewage directly into the river and its tributaries.\nThe UK has combined sewage systems which mean rain and sewage share the same pipes, so if there is too much rain, sewage treatment works can be overwhelmed. Sewage is spilled into waterways to prevent the system backing up.\nSewage spilling can be legal but environmentalists say it should only happen in exceptional weather.\nIndustry body Water UK cited record levels of rainfall but called the situation \"unacceptable\". \nA government spokesperson also said sewage discharged into UK waters was \"completely unacceptable and water companies need to clean up their act fast\". \nThey went on to say the government is taking \"tough action to hold them to account\", with \"stringent targets in place\"  and the quadrupling of water company inspections.\nIn a statement issued before the race, Thames Water said: \"We have experienced higher than average long-term rainfall across London and the Thames Valley with groundwater levels exceptionally high for the time of the year.\n\"The overflows are designed to operate automatically when the sewer network is about to be overwhelmed, which then releases diluted wastewater into rivers, rather than letting it back up into people's homes.\n\"We are working hard to make these discharges unnecessary and have published plans to upgrade over 250 of our sites.\"",

I have been at sea quite a lot before and have never seen seas as big in my life. \"At one point we were surfing down 30ft waves at 10 knots.\"When you look back at them, it almost looks like the wave was going to come over and swamp you.\"\nMr Ferrier said he had followed the race for the past 10 years and it had \"always\" been on his bucket list.He originally planned to do it for his 60th birthday, but teamed up with Mr Hoyle and put it off for two years.

They all absolutely love it.\"\nThe Warrington Youth Rowing Club charity has hubs across Warrington, Liverpool, Northwich and Manchester. \nEvery year, about 450 young people take part in the programme.\nOne Year 8 student, Lilly, said she had fallen in love with the sport after taking part\nPreviously she had only seen rowers on television.\n\"Doing rowing is a big change for me but it is really fun to do,\" she said.\nAnother student in her year, T'coa, also said she found the sport very enjoyable.\n\"My grandad watches [rowing] a lot on the tv so I've seen it but never done it before now,\" she said. \"I'd love to do it more in the future.\"\nMeanwhile a third Year 8 student, Lleyton, said his teamworking and adaptation skills had all been boosted as a result of starting to row.\n\"We have to sync and stay in time and talk to each other, give each other options on what to do,\" he said.\nCrew mate Bradie explained: \"We're mostly communicating and just trying to stay in time with each other so we don't hit our oars together.\"\nTheir headteacher, Jo Langstaff, said she welcomed the opportunity to learn outside of the typical classroom environment, and said the scheme helped raise levels of attainment and ambition. \n\"It gives our students the opportunity to consider a sport that they otherwise wouldn't have considered,\" she said.\n\"Coming into school and knowing they are going to be out on the river - be active, be part of a team and compete - it just inspires them.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?
